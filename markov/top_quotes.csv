"1" "Sokka" "  It's not getting away from me this time.  Watch and learn, Katara.  This is how you catch a fish."
"2" "Katara" "  Sokka, look!"
"3" "Sokka" "   Shhh.  Katara, you're gonna scare it away.  Mmmm. . .  I can already smell it cookin'!"
"4" "Katara" "  But Sokka!  I caught one!"
"5" "Katara" "  Hey!"
"6" "Sokka" "  Ugh!  Why is it that every time you play with magic water I get soaked?"
"7" "Katara" "  It's not magic.  It's waterbending, and it's-"
"8" "Sokka" "  Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah.  Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself."
"9" "Katara" "  You're calling me weird?  I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water."
"10" "Katara" "  Watch out!  Go left!  Go left!"
"11" "Katara" "  You call that left?"
"12" "Sokka" "  You don't like my steering.  Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice."
"13" "Katara" "  So it's my fault?"
"14" "Sokka" "  I knew I should have left you home.  Leave it to a girl to screw things up."
"15" "Katara" "  You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained. . ."
"16" "Katara" "  Ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!  Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!"
"17" "Sokka" "  Uh. . .  Katara?"
"18" "Katara" "  I even wash all the clothes!  Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?  Let me tell you, NOT PLEASANT!"
"19" "Sokka" "  Katara!  Settle down!"
"20" "Katara" "  No, that's it.  I'm done helping you.  From now on, you're on your own!"
"21" "Sokka" "  Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara."
"22" "Katara" "  You mean I did that?"
"23" "Sokka" "  Yup.  Congratulations."
"24" "Katara" "  He's alive!  We have to help."
"25" "Sokka" "  Katara!  Get back here!  We don't know what that thing is!"
"26" "Zuko" "  Finally.   Uncle, do you realize what this means?"
"27" "Iroh" "  I won't get to finish my game?"
"28" "Zuko" "  It means my search -  it's about to come to an end."
"29" "Zuko" "  That light came from an incredibly powerful source.  It has to be him!"
"30" "Iroh" "  Or it's just the celestial lights.  We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.  I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.  Please, sit.  Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?"
"31" "Zuko" "  I don't need any calming tea!  I need to capture the Avatar.  Helmsman, head a course for the light!"
"32" "Sokka" "  Stop!"
"33" "Katara" "  Stop it!"
"34" "Aang" "  I need to ask you something."
"35" "Katara" "  What?"
"36" "Aang" "  Please. . .  come closer."
"37" "Katara" "  What is it?"
"38" "Aang" "  Will you go penguin sledding with me?"
"39" "Katara" "  Uh. . .  sure.  I guess."
"40" "Sokka" "  Ahh!"
"41" "Aang" "  What's going on here?"
"42" "Sokka" "  You tell us!  How'd you get in the ice?   And why aren't you frozen?"
"43" "Aang" "  I'm not sure."
"44" "Aang" "  Appa!  Are you all right?  Wake up, buddy."
"45" "Aang" "  Haha!  You're okay!"
"46" "Sokka" "  What is that thing?"
"47" "Aang" "  This is Appa, my flying bison."
"48" "Sokka" "  Right.  And this is Katara, my flying sister."
"49" "Sokka" "  Ewww!  Aahh! ! !"
"50" "Aang" "  Don't worry.  It'll wash out."
"51" "Sokka" "  Ugh!"
"52" "Aang" "  So, do you guys live around here?"
"53" "Sokka" "  Don't answer that!  Did you see that crazy bolt of light?  He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy."
"54" "Katara" "  Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.  You can tell by that evil look in his eye."
"55" "Katara" "  The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka.  You never told us your name."
"56" "Aang" "  I'm A. . .  aaaahhhh. . .  ahhhhhh. . . .  aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!"
"57" "Aang" "  I'm Aang."
"58" "Sokka" "   You just sneezed. . .  and flew ten feet in the air."
"59" "Aang" "  Really?  It felt higher that that."
"60" "Katara" "  You're an airbender!"
"61" "Aang" "  Sure am."
"62" "Sokka" "  Giant light beams. . .  flying bison. . .  airbenders. . .  I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.  I'm going home to where stuff makes sense."
"63" "Aang" "  Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift."
"64" "Katara" "  We'd love a ride!  Thanks!"
"65" "Sokka" "  Oh, no. . .  I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster."
"66" "Katara" "  Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?  You know. . .  before you freeze to death?"
"67" "Aang" "  Okay.  First time flyers, hold on tight!  Appa, yip yip!"
"68" "Aang" "  Come on, Appa.  Yip yip."
"69" "Sokka" "  Wow.  That was truly amazing."
"70" "Aang" "  Appa's just tired.  A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky.  You'll see."
"71" "Katara" "  Why are you smiling at me like that?"
"72" "Aang" "  Oh. . .  I was smiling?"
"73" "Sokka" "  Uuuuugh."
"74" "Iroh" "  I'm going to bed now.   Yep.  A man needs his rest.  Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.  Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.  Your father, grandfather, and great- grandfather all tried and failed."
"75" "Zuko" "  Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.  Mine does.  This coward's hundred years in hiding are over."
"76" "Katara" "  Hey."
"77" "Aang" "  Hey.  Whatcha thinkin' about?"
"78" "Katara" "  I guess I was wondering –  your being an airbender and all –  if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar."
"79" "Aang" "  Uhh. . .  no.  I didn't know him. . .  I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.  Sorry."
"80" "Katara" "  Okay.  Just curious.  Goodnight."
"81" "Aang" "  Sleep tight."
"82" "Aang" "  Aaahhh!"
"83" "Katara" "  Aang!  Aang, wake up!   It's okay.  We're in the village now.  Come on, get ready.  Everyone's waiting to meet you."
"84" "Aang" "  Whaaaa!"
"85" "Katara" "  Aang, this is the entire village.  Entire village, Aang."
"86" "Aang" "  Uh. . .  why are they all looking at me like that?  Did Appa sneeze on me?"
"87" "Aang" "  'Extinct'?"
"88" "Katara" "  Aang, this is my grandmother."
"89" "Sokka" "  What is this, a weapon?  You can't stab anything with this."
"90" "Aang" "  It's not for stabbing.   It's for airbending."
"91" "Aang" "  Not magic, airbending.  It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly."
"92" "Sokka" "  You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly."
"93" "Aang" "  Check again!"
"94" "Aang" "  Oof!"
"95" "Sokka" "  My watchtower!"
"96" "Katara" "  That was amazing."
"97" "Sokka" "  Great.  You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long."
"98" "Aang" "  You're a waterbender!"
"99" "Katara" "  Well. . .  sort of.  Not yet."
"100" "Katara" "  I told you!  He's the real thing, Gran Gran!  I finally found a bender to teach me."
"101" "Katara" "  But he's special.  I can tell.  I sense he's filled with much wisdom."
"102" "Aang" "   Sthee?  Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff."
"103" "Iroh" "  Again."
"104" "Zuko" "  Ha!  Heeya!"
"105" "Iroh" "  No!  Power in firebending comes from the breath.  Not the muscles.  The breath becomes energy in the body.  The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.   Get it right this time."
"106" "Zuko" "  Enough.  I've been drilling this sequence all day.  Teach me the next set.  I'm more than ready."
"107" "Iroh" "  No, you are impatient.  You have yet to master your basics.   Drill it again!"
"108" "Zuko" "  Grrrr. . .  huh!   The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.  He must be over a hundred years old by now.  He's had a century to master the four elements.  I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.  You WILL teach me the advanced set!"
"109" "Iroh" "  Very well.  But first I must finish my roast duck.   Num num. . .  num. . ."
"110" "Sokka" "  Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.  In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.  For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?"
"111" "Sokka" "  Listen!  Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.  And that means no potty breaks."
"112" "Sokka" "  Okay. . .  who else has to go?"
"113" "Katara" "  Have you seen Aang?  Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago."
"114" "Aang" "  Wow!  Everything freezes in there!"
"115" "Sokka" "  Ugh!  Katara, get him out of here.  This lesson is for warriors only."
"116" "Sokka" "  Stop!  Stop it right now!   What's wrong with you?  We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on."
"117" "Aang" "  What war?   What are you talking about?"
"118" "Sokka" "  You're kidding, right?"
"119" "Aang" "  PENGUIN!"
"120" "Sokka" "  He's kidding, right?"
"121" "Aang" "  Haha!  Hey, come on little guy.  Wanna go sledding?"
"122" "Aang" "  Oof!  Heh heh, I have a way with animals.   Yarp!  Yarp yarp!  Yarp!  Yarp yarp!  Yarp!"
"123" "Katara" "   Hahaha. . .  Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending."
"124" "Aang" "  You got a deal!  Just one little problem.  I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.  Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?"
"125" "Katara" "  No.  You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole."
"126" "Aang" "  This isn't right.  A waterbender needs to master water.  What about the North Pole?  There's another Water Tribe up there, right?  Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you."
"127" "Katara" "  Maybe.  But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.  It's not exactly 'turn right at the second glacier. ' It's on the other side of the world."
"128" "Aang" ""
"129" "Katara" "  That's. . .   I mean, I don't know.  I've never left home before."
"130" "Aang" "  Well, you think about it.  But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?"
"131" "Katara" "  Okay, listen closely my young pupil.  Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.  Observe."
"132" "Katara" "  I haven't done this since I was a kid!"
"133" "Aang" "  You still are a kid!"
"134" "Aang" "  Whoa. . .  what is that?"
"135" "Katara" "  A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people."
"136" "Katara" "  Aang, stop!  We're not allowed to go near it.  The ship could be booby trapped."
"137" "Aang" "  If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear."
"138" "Katara" "  This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.  It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks."
"139" "Aang" "  Okay, back up.  I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation.  I've never seen any war."
"140" "Katara" "  Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?"
"141" "Aang" "  I don't know. . .  a few days, maybe?"
"142" "Katara" "  I think it was more like a hundred years!"
"143" "Aang" "  What?  That's impossible.  Do I look like a hundred- twelve year old man to you?"
"144" "Katara" "  Think about it.  The war is a century old.  You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there that whole time.  It's the only explanation."
"145" "Aang" "  A hundred years!  I can't believe it."
"146" "Katara" "  I'm sorry, Aang.  Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this."
"147" "Aang" "  I did get to meet you."
"148" "Katara" "  Come on.  Let's get out of here."
"149" "Katara" "  Aang?  Let's head back.  This place is creepy."
"150" "Aang" "  Huh?"
"151" "Aang" "  What's that you said about booby traps?"
"152" "Aang" "  Uh oh."
"153" "Aang" "  Hold on tight!"
"154" "Zuko" "  The last airbender.   Quite agile for his old age.  Wake my uncle!  Tell him I found the Avatar. . ."
"155" "Zuko" "  . . . as well as his hiding place."
"156" "Sokka" "  I knew it!  You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare!  You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?"
"157" "Katara" "  Aang didn't do anything.  It was an accident."
"158" "Aang" "  Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well. . .   . . . we “boobied” right into it."
"159" "Aang" "  Don't blame Katara!  I brought her there.   It's my fault."
"160" "Sokka" "  Aha!  The traitor confesses!  Warriors, away from the enemy!   The foreigner is banned from our village!"
"161" "Katara" "  Sokka, you're making a mistake."
"162" "Sokka" "  No!  I'm keeping my promise to Dad.  I'm protecting you from threats like him!"
"163" "Katara" "  Aang is not our enemy!  Don't you see?  Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time.  Fun."
"164" "Sokka" "  Fun?  We can't fight firebenders with fun!"
"165" "Aang" "  You should try it sometime."
"166" "Sokka" "  Get out of our village.  Now!"
"167" "Katara" "  Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this."
"168" "Katara" "  Then I'm banished too!"
"169" "Katara" "  C'mon, Aang, let's go!"
"170" "Sokka" "  Where do you think you're going?"
"171" "Katara" "  To find a waterbender!  Aang is taking me to the North Pole!"
"172" "Aang" "  I am?  Great!"
"173" "Sokka" "  Katara!   Would you really choose him over your tribe?  Your own family?"
"174" "Aang" "  Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family."
"175" "Katara" "  So, you're leaving the South Pole?  This is goodbye?"
"176" "Aang" "  Thanks for penguin sledding with me."
"177" "Katara" "  Where will you go?"
"178" "Aang" "  Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.   Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years.  Not looking forward to that."
"179" "Aang" "  It was nice meeting everyone."
"180" "Sokka" "  Let's see your bison fly now, air boy."
"181" "Aang" "  Come on, Appa, you can do it!  Yip!  Yip!"
"182" "Sokka" "  Yeh, I thought so."
"183" "Aang" "  I'll miss you too."
"184" "Aang" "  Come on, boy."
"185" "Katara" "  You happy now?  There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!"
"186" "Sokka" "  All right!  Ready our defenses!  The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!"
"187" "Sokka" "  And no potty breaks!"
"188" "Aang" "  Yeh, I liked her too."
"189" "Aang" "  The village!   Appa, wait here!"
"190" "Sokka" "  Oh man!"
"191" "Sokka" "  Ohhh, man!"
"192" "Katara" "  Sokka, get out of the way!"
"193" "Zuko" "  Where are you hiding him?"
"194" "Zuko" "  He'd be about this age?  Master of all elements?"
"195" "Zuko" "  I know you're hiding him!"
"196" "Aang" "  Hey Katara.  Hey Sokka."
"197" "Sokka" "  Hi. . . Aang.  Thanks for comin'."
"198" "Aang" "  Looking for me?"
"199" "Zuko" "  You're the airbender?  You're the Avatar?"
"200" "Katara" "  Aang?"
"201" "Sokka" "  No way."
"202" "Zuko" "  I've spent years preparing for this encounter.  Training.  Meditating.  You're just a child!"
"203" "Aang" "  Well, you're just a teenager."
"204" "Aang" "  If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?"
"205" "Katara" "  No, Aang!  Don't do this!"
"206" "Aang" "  Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.   Take care of Appa for me until I get back."
"207" "Zuko" "  Head a course to the Fire Nation.  I'm going home."
"208" "Katara" "  We have to go after that ship, Sokka.  Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him."
"209" "Sokka" "  Katara, I—"
"210" "Katara" "  Why can't you realize that he's on our side?  If we don't help him, no one will.  I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I—"
"211" "Sokka" "  Katara!  Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?"
"212" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"213" "Sokka" "  Get in.  We're going to save your boyfriend."
"214" "Katara" "  He's not my—"
"215" "Sokka" "  Whatever."
"216" "Sokka" "  Yeah. . .  okay, Gran."
"217" "Katara" "  There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe."
"218" "Katara" "  Appa!"
"219" "Sokka" "  You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?"
"220" "Zuko" "  This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.  I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.  Take the Avatar to the prison hold.  And  take this to my quarters."
"221" "Iroh" "  Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?"
"222" "Aang" "  So. . .  I guess you never fought an airbender before.  I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back."
"223" "Sokka" "  Go.  Fly.  Soar."
"224" "Katara" "  Please, Appa, we need your help.  Aang needs your help."
"225" "Sokka" "  Up.  Ascend.  Elevate."
"226" "Katara" "  Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.   Come on.  Don't you wanna save Aang?"
"227" "Sokka" "  What was it that kid said?  Yee- ha?  Hup hup?  Wahoo?  Uh. . .  yip yip?"
"228" "Katara" "  You did it, Sokka!"
"229" "Sokka" "  He's flying!  He's flying!  Katara, he's— !   I mean, big deal, he's flying."
"230" "Aang" "  You haven't seen my staff around, have you?"
"231" "Aang" "  Thanks anyway!"
"232" "Aang" "  Sorry. . ."
"233" "Aang" "  My staff!"
"234" "Zuko" "  Looks like I underestimated you."
"235" "Zuko" "  What is that?"
"236" "Aang" "  Appa!"
"237" "Katara" "  Aang!  No!"
"238" "Katara" "  Aang!  Aang!  AANG!"
"239" "Katara" "  Did you see what he just did?"
"240" "Sokka" "  Now that was some waterbending!"
"241" "Katara" "  Aang!  Are you okay?"
"242" "Aang" "  Hey Katara.  Hey Sokka.  Thanks for coming."
"243" "Sokka" "  Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory."
"244" "Aang" "  I dropped my staff."
"245" "Sokka" "  Got it!"
"246" "Sokka" "  Ha!  That's from the Water Tribe!"
"247" "Sokka" "  Katara!"
"248" "Katara" "  Hurry up, Sokka!"
"249" "Sokka" "  I'm just a guy with a boomerang; I didn't ask for all this flying and magic."
"250" "Sokka" "  Yip yip!  Yip yip!"
"251" "Iroh" "  Huh?"
"252" "Zuko" "  Shoot them down!"
"253" "Iroh" "  Good news for the Fire Lord.  The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid."
"254" "Zuko" "  That kid, Uncle, just did this.   I won't underestimate him again.  Dig this ship out and follow them!   As soon as you're done with that."
"255" "Katara" "  How did you do that?  With the water?  It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen."
"256" "Aang" "  I don't know.  I just sort of. . .  did it."
"257" "Katara" "  Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?"
"258" "Aang" "  Because. . .  I never wanted to be."
"259" "Katara" "  But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war."
"260" "Aang" "  And how am I going to do that?"
"261" "Katara" "  According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?"
"262" "Aang" "  That's what the monks told me."
"263" "Katara" "  Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending."
"264" "Aang" "  We can learn it together!"
"265" "Katara" "  And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way."
"266" "Sokka" "  I'd like that.  I'd really like that."
"267" "Katara" "  Then we're in this together."
"268" "Aang" "  All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to  here, here, and here."
"269" "Katara" "  What's there?"
"270" "Aang" "  Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas.  Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.  Then back over here we'll ride the hog- monkeys.  They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!"
"271" "Aang" "   Wait 'til you see it, Katara.  The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world."
"272" "Katara" "   Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home."
"273" "Aang" "  That's why I'm so excited!"
"274" "Katara" "  It's just that a lot can change in all that time."
"275" "Aang" "  I know, but I need to see it for myself."
"276" "Aang" "  Wake up, Sokka!  Air Temple here we come!"
"277" "Sokka" "  Sleep now. . .  temple later. . ."
"278" "Aang" "  Sokka!  Wake up!   There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!"
"279" "Sokka" "   Aaahhh!  Get it off!  Get it off!  Aaahhh!"
"280" "Aang" "   Great!  You're awake.  Let's go."
"281" "Zuko" "  Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.  I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail."
"282" "Iroh" "  You mean the Avatar?"
"283" "Zuko" "   Don't mention his name on these docks!  Once word gets out that he's alive every firebender will be out looking for him and I don't want anyone getting in the way."
"284" "Zuko" "   Captain Zhao."
"285" "Iroh" "  Retired general."
"286" "Iroh" "  Our ship is being repaired."
"287" "Zuko" "  Yes. . .  you wouldn't believe what happened.   Uncle!  Tell Commander Zhao what happened."
"288" "Iroh" "  Yes, I will do that.  It was incredible.   What. . .  did we crash or something?"
"289" "Zuko" "   Uh, yes!  Right into an Earth Kingdom ship."
"290" "Zuko" "  Sorry, but we have to go."
"291" "Iroh" "  Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.   We would be honored to join you.  Do you have any ginseng tea?  It's my favorite."
"292" "Sokka" "   Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?  I'm trying to find us some food."
"293" "Sokka" "  Hey!  Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?"
"294" "Aang" "  Oh, that was food?  I used it to start the campfire last night.  Sorry."
"295" "Sokka" "   You WHAT?  Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good."
"296" "Aang" "  The Batola mountain range!  We're almost there!"
"297" "Katara" "   Aang?  Before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders."
"298" "Aang" "  What about 'em?"
"299" "Katara" "   Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see.  The Fire Nation is ruthless.  They killed my mother and they could have done the same to your people."
"300" "Aang" "   Just because no one has seen an airbender doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.   They probably escaped."
"301" "Katara" "  I know it's hard to accept."
"302" "Aang" "  You don't understand, Katara.  The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison.  Right, Appa?"
"303" "Aang" "   Yip yip!"
"304" "Aang" "  There it is. . .  the Southern Air Temple."
"305" "Katara" "  Aang, it's amazing!"
"306" "Aang" "   We're home, buddy.  We're home."
"307" "Zuko" "   If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool."
"308" "Iroh" "   My fault entirely."
"309" "Zuko" "   We haven't found him yet."
"310" "Zuko" "   No.  Nothing."
"311" "Zuko" "   I haven't found anything.  It's like you said.  The Avatar probably died a long time ago.  Come on, Uncle, we're going."
"312" "Sokka" "  So where do I get something to eat?"
"313" "Katara" "  You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple and all you can think about is food?"
"314" "Sokka" "  I'm just a simple guy with simple needs."
"315" "Aang" "  So that's where my friends and I would play airball!"
"316" "Aang" "  And. . .  over there would be where the bison would sleep. . .  and. . ."
"317" "Katara" "  What's wrong?"
"318" "Aang" "  This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison.  Now there's just a bunch of weeds."
"319" "Aang" "  I can't believe how much things have changed."
"320" "Sokka" "  So, uh, this airball game?  How do you play?"
"321" "Aang" "  Hahaha!  Aang seven, Sokka zero!"
"322" "Sokka" "   Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt."
"323" "Sokka" "  Katara, check this out."
"324" "Katara" "   Fire Nation."
"325" "Sokka" "  We should tell him."
"326" "Katara" "   Aang, there's something you need to see."
"327" "Aang" "   Okay!"
"328" "Aang" "  What is it?"
"329" "Katara" "   Uh. . .  just a new waterbending move I learned."
"330" "Aang" "  Nice one.  But enough practicing.  We have a whole temple to see!"
"331" "Sokka" "  You know, you can't protect him forever."
"332" "Sokka" "  Katara, firebenders were here.  You can't pretend they weren't."
"333" "Katara" "   I can for Aang's sake."
"334" "Katara" "  If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated."
"335" "Aang" "   Hey guys!"
"336" "Aang" "  I want you to meet somebody."
"337" "Sokka" "  Who's that?"
"338" "Aang" "  Monk Gyatso, the greatest airbender in the world.  He taught me everything I know."
"339" "Aang" "  Hmm. . ."
"340" "Aang" "  This whole Avatar thing. . .  maybe the monks made a mistake."
"341" "Aang" "   But Gyatso, how do I know if I'm ready for this?"
"342" "Aang" "   Who is it?"
"343" "Aang" "   All right."
"344" "Katara" "   You must miss him."
"345" "Aang" "  Yeah."
"346" "Katara" "  Where are you going?"
"347" "Aang" "   The Air Temple Sanctuary.  There's someone I'm ready to meet."
"348" "Katara" "  But Aang. . .  no one could have survived in there for a hundred years."
"349" "Aang" "  It's not impossible.  I survived in the iceberg for that long."
"350" "Katara" "  Good point."
"351" "Aang" "  Katara, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing!"
"352" "Sokka" "   And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious, cured meats!"
"353" "Sokka" "  I don't suppose you have a key?"
"354" "Aang" "  The key, Sokka, is airbending."
"355" "Aang" "   Hello?  Anyone home?"
"356" "Zuko" "  I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again."
"357" "Zuko" "   Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I. . ."
"358" "Iroh" "  More tea please?"
"359" "Sokka" "  Statues? !  That's it?  Where's the meat?"
"360" "Katara" "  Who are all these people?"
"361" "Aang" "   I'm not sure, but it feels like I know them somehow.  Look!   That one's an airbender!"
"362" "Katara" "   And this one's a waterbender.  They're lined up in a pattern.  Air, water, earth and fire."
"363" "Aang" "  That's the Avatar cycle."
"364" "Katara" "  Of course!  They're Avatars.  All these people are your past lives, Aang."
"365" "Aang" "  Wow!  There's so many!"
"366" "Sokka" "   Past lives?  Katara, you really believe in that stuff?"
"367" "Katara" "  It's true.  When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle. ."
"368" "Katara" "  Aang, snap out of it!"
"369" "Aang" "   Huh?"
"370" "Katara" "  Who is that?"
"371" "Aang" "  That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me."
"372" "Sokka" "  You were a firebender?  No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met."
"373" "Katara" "  There's no writing.  How do you know his name?"
"374" "Aang" "  I'm not sure. . .  I just know it somehow."
"375" "Sokka" "   You just couldn't get any weirder!"
"376" "Sokka" "   Firebender.  Nobody make a sound."
"377" "Katara" "   You're making a sound!"
"378" "Aang" "  Lemur!"
"379" "Sokka" "   Dinner. . ."
"380" "Aang" "  Don't listen to him!  You're going to be my new pet."
"381" "Sokka" "  Not if I get him first!"
"382" "Aang" "   Wait!  Come back!"
"383" "Sokka" "  I wanna eat you!"
"384" "Sokka" "  Oof!"
"385" "Sokka" "  Hey!  No Fair!"
"386" "Zuko" "  Why?  Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?"
"387" "Zuko" "   Don't underestimate me, Zhao.  I will capture the Avatar before you."
"388" "Iroh" "   Prince Zuko, that's enough!"
"389" "Zuko" "  You're wrong.  Once I deliver the Avatar to my father he will welcome me home with honor and restore my rightful place on the throne."
"390" "Zuko" "  That's not true."
"391" "Zuko" "   Maybe you'd like one to match!"
"392" "Zuko" "  An agni kai.  At sunset."
"393" "Iroh" "  Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?"
"394" "Zuko" "  I will never forget."
"395" "Aang" "  Hey!  Come back!"
"396" "Aang" "  Come on out, little lemur.  That hungry guy won't bother you anymore."
"397" "Aang" "   Firebenders?  They were here?"
"398" "Aang" "  Gyatso. . ."
"399" "Sokka" "   Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet?"
"400" "Sokka" "  Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?   Oh, man. . .  come on, Aang, everything will be all right.  Let's get out of here."
"401" "Katara" "   Aang!"
"402" "Sokka" "  Aang!  Come on, snap out of it!"
"403" "Sokka" "  Aaahhh!"
"404" "Katara" "  What happened?"
"405" "Sokka" "  He found out firebenders killed Gyatso."
"406" "Katara" "  Oh no, it's his avatar spirit!  He must have triggered it!  I'm gonna try and calm him down."
"407" "Sokka" "   Well, do it before he blows us off the mountain!"
"408" "Iroh" "  Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko.  They are your greatest weapons."
"409" "Zuko" "   I refuse to let him win."
"410" "Iroh" "  Basics, Zuko!  Break his root!"
"411" "Zuko" "  Next time you get in my way, I promise I won't hold back."
"412" "Iroh" "  No, Prince Zuko.  Do not taint your victory."
"413" "Iroh" "  So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat.   Disgraceful."
"414" "Iroh" "  Even in exile my nephew is more honorable than you.   Thanks again for the tea.  It was delicious."
"415" "Zuko" "   Did you really mean that, Uncle?"
"416" "Iroh" "   Of course.  I told you ginseng tea is my favorite."
"417" "Katara" "   Aang, I know you're upset. . ."
"418" "Katara" "  . . .  and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love.  I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.  Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family.  Sokka and I, we're your family now."
"419" "Sokka" "   Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you.  Promise."
"420" "Aang" "   I'm sorry."
"421" "Katara" "  It's okay.  It wasn't your fault."
"422" "Aang" "   But you were right.  And if firebenders found this temple that means they found the other ones, too.  I really am the last airbender."
"423" "Katara" "  Everything's packed.  You ready to go?"
"424" "Aang" "   How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?"
"425" "Katara" "  Maybe you'll find a way."
"426" "Aang" "  Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka."
"427" "Sokka" "   Can't talk.  Must eat."
"428" "Aang" "   Hey little guy."
"429" "Aang" "  You, me, and Appa.   We're all that's left of this place.  We have to stick together.  Katara, Sokka. . ."
"430" "Aang" "  . . .  say hello to the newest member of our family."
"431" "Katara" "  What are you going to name him?"
"432" "Aang" "   Momo."
"433" "Zuko" "   The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar."
"434" "Iroh" "   Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it.  Don't get too upset."
"435" "Zuko" "   Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader.  Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it."
"436" "Iroh" "  Okay, then. . .  we have no idea where he is."
"437" "Zuko" "   WHAT? !"
"438" "Iroh" "   You really should open a window in here."
"439" "Zuko" "   Give me the map!"
"440" "Iroh" "  There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down."
"441" "Zuko" "  How am I gonna find him, Uncle?"
"442" "Zuko" "  He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering."
"443" "Sokka" "  You have no idea where you're going, do you?"
"444" "Aang" "   Weeelll, I know it's near water. . ."
"445" "Sokka" "   I guess we're getting close then."
"446" "Aang" "  Momo, marbles please."
"447" "Aang" "   Hey Katara!  Check out this airbending trick!"
"448" "Katara" "   That's great, Aang."
"449" "Aang" "   You didn't even look."
"450" "Katara" "   That's great!"
"451" "Aang" "  But I'm not doing it now."
"452" "Sokka" "   Stop bugging her, airhead.  You need to give girls space when they do their sewing."
"453" "Katara" "  What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?"
"454" "Sokka" ""
"455" "Katara" "   All done with your pants!  And look what a great job I did!"
"456" "Sokka" "  Wait!  I was just kidding!  I can't wear these!   Katara, PLEASE!"
"457" "Aang" "  Don't worry, Sokka.  Where we're going, you won't need any pants!  But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy?  I said, aren't you boy?"
"458" "Sokka" "  Yeah, that was real convincing.  Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster."
"459" "Aang" "   LOOK!   That's why we're here. . .  . . .  elephant koi.  And I'm going to ride it.  Katara, you've gotta watch me!   COLD!"
"460" "Katara" "   Woo!"
"461" "Aang" "  Yeeaaaah!  Woohoo!"
"462" "Katara" "  He looks pretty good out there."
"463" "Sokka" "  Are you kidding?  The fish is doing all the work."
"464" "Katara" "   No, Appa!  Don't eat that!"
"465" "Aang" "  Aww, man. . ."
"466" "Sokka" "   There's something in the water!"
"467" "Katara" "  What's wrong?"
"468" "Sokka" "  Aang's in trouble.   Aang!"
"469" "Katara" "   Get out of there!"
"470" "Sokka" "  Come back here!  AANG!"
"471" "Katara" "  AANG!"
"472" "Aang" "  Aaahhh!"
"473" "Katara" "  What was that thing?"
"474" "Aang" "  I don't know."
"475" "Sokka" "   Well, let's not stick around and find out.  Time to hit the road."
"476" "Aang" "   Ugh!"
"477" "Katara" "   Uhh. . ."
"478" "Sokka" "   Oof. . .  Or we could stay a while. . ."
"479" "Sokka" "   Show yourselves, cowards!"
"480" "Sokka" "   Who are you?  Where are the men who ambushed us?"
"481" "Sokka" "   Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down."
"482" "Katara" "   No, don't hurt him!  He didn't mean it.  My brother is just an idiot sometimes."
"483" "Aang" "   It's my fault.  I'm sorry we came here.  I wanted to ride the elephant koi."
"484" "Aang" "  This island is named for Kyoshi?  I know Kyoshi!"
"485" "Aang" "  I know her because I'm the Avatar."
"486" "Aang" "  That's me!"
"487" "Katara" "   Aang. . .  do some airbending. . ."
"488" "Aang" "  Now. . .  check this out!"
"489" "Zuko" "   The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?   Uncle, ready the rhinos.  He's not getting away from me this time."
"490" "Iroh" "  Are you going to finish that?"
"491" "Zuko" "  I was going to save it for later!"
"492" "Aang" "  All right!  Dessert for breakfast!   These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!"
"493" "Aang" "  Mmm. . .  Katara you've got to try these!"
"494" "Katara" "  Well, maybe just a bite. . ."
"495" "Aang" "   Sokka, what's your problem?  EAT!"
"496" "Sokka" "  Not hungry."
"497" "Aang" "  But you're always hungry!"
"498" "Katara" "  He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday."
"499" "Sokka" "  They snuck up on me!"
"500" "Katara" "   Right.  And then they kicked your butt."
"501" "Sokka" "   Sneak attacks don't count!   Tie me up with ropes!  I'll show them a thing or two.  I'm not scared of any girls.   Who do they think they are anyway?   Mmm. . .  this is tasty."
"502" "Aang" "  What's he so angry about?  It's great here.  They're giving us the royal treatment."
"503" "Katara" "  Hey, don't get too comfortable.  It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long."
"504" "Aang" "  I'm sure we'll be fine.  Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?   They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!"
"505" "Katara" "  Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.  I just hope it doesn't all go to your head."
"506" "Aang" "  Come on, you know me better than that.  I'm just a simple monk."
"507" "Sokka" "   Sorry ladies!  Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.   I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?"
"508" "Sokka" "   It's all right.  I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception."
"509" "Sokka" "  True.  But don't feel bad.  After all, I'm the best warrior in my village."
"510" "Sokka" "  Oh. . .  well. . .  I mean. . .  I. . ."
"511" "Sokka" "  Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to.  All right, you stand over there.   This may be a little tough, but try to block me."
"512" "Sokka" "   Heh heh. . .  good.  Of course, I was going easy on you."
"513" "Sokka" "  Let's see if you can handle this!"
"514" "Sokka" "   That does it!"
"515" "Aang" "  There she is, girls.  Me in a past life."
"516" "Aang" "  Excuse me for a second, ladies."
"517" "Katara" "   Oh, good!  Can you help me carry this back to the room?  It's a little heavy."
"518" "Aang" "  Actually, I can't right now."
"519" "Katara" "   What do you mean you can't?"
"520" "Aang" "  I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa.  Why don'tyou come with us?  It'll be fun!"
"521" "Katara" "   Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun."
"522" "Aang" "  Well, neither does carrying your basket."
"523" "Katara" "  It's not my basket.  These supplies are for our trip.  I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon."
"524" "Aang" "  I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet.  I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place."
"525" "Katara" "   Aangy. . ."
"526" "Aang" "   Just a second, Koko!"
"527" "Katara" "  'Simple monk,' huh?  I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head."
"528" "Aang" "  It didn't.  You know what I think?  You just don't want to come because you're jealous."
"529" "Katara" "  Jealous?  Of what?"
"530" "Aang" "  Jealous that we're having so much fun without you."
"531" "Katara" "   That's ridiculous."
"532" "Aang" "  It is a little ridiculous, but I understand."
"533" "Sokka" "   Uh. . .  hey, Suki."
"534" "Sokka" "  No. . .  I. . .  well, let me explain."
"535" "Sokka" "   I would be honored if you would teach me."
"536" "Sokka" "   I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier.  I was wrong."
"537" "Sokka" "  Please make an exception.  I won't let you down."
"538" "Sokka" "   Of course!"
"539" "Sokka" "  Do I really have to wear this?  It feels a little. . .  girly."
"540" "Sokka" "   Bravery and honor."
"541" "Aang" "   Hey Sokka!  Nice dress!"
"542" "Aang" "  Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?"
"543" "Katara" "   Yeah."
"544" "Aang" "  Well, I'm gonna go ride it now.  It's gonna be REAL dangerous."
"545" "Katara" "   Good for you."
"546" "Aang" "   You're not going to stop me?"
"547" "Katara" "   Nope.  Have fun."
"548" "Aang" "   I will."
"549" "Katara" "  Great."
"550" "Aang" "  I know it's great."
"551" "Katara" "  I'm glad you know."
"552" "Aang" "  I'm glad you're glad."
"553" "Katara" "  Good!"
"554" "Aang" "  Fine!"
"555" "Sokka" "   I think I'm starting to get it."
"556" "Sokka" "   Hmm. . ."
"557" "Sokka" "   I got you!  Admit I got you!"
"558" "Aang" "  I'm sure it will be here any second!   What about this?"
"559" "Aang" "  Where're you going?  Don't leave!"
"560" "Aang" "   Katara!  You came!"
"561" "Katara" "  I wanted to make sure you were safe.  You really had me worried."
"562" "Aang" "  Back there you acted like you didn't care."
"563" "Katara" "  I'm sorry."
"564" "Aang" "  Me too.  I did let all that attention go to my head.  I was being a jerk."
"565" "Katara" "   Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!"
"566" "Aang" "   On my way!"
"567" "Katara" "  Zuko!"
"568" "Katara" "  Wake up, Aang!"
"569" "Aang" "   Katara. . .  don't ride the unagi.  Not fun."
"570" "Sokka" "  Hey, I'm not a. . .  oh, whatever!"
"571" "Zuko" "  Come out, Avatar!  You can't hide from me forever!   Find him."
"572" "Sokka" "  I guess training's over."
"573" "Zuko" "  Nice try, Avatar!  But these little girls can't save you."
"574" "Aang" "  Hey!  Over here!"
"575" "Zuko" "  Finally!"
"576" "Katara" "  Get inside."
"577" "Aang" "   Look what I brought to this place."
"578" "Katara" "  It's not your fault."
"579" "Aang" "  Yes, it is.  These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me."
"580" "Katara" "  Then let's get out of here.  Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.  I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way."
"581" "Aang" "   I'll call Appa."
"582" "Sokka" "  What about, I'm sorry?"
"583" "Sokka" "  I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior."
"584" "Aang" "  Appa, yip yip!"
"585" "Zuko" "   Back to the ship!  Don't lose sight of them!"
"586" "Katara" "  I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.  Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.  They're going to be okay, Aang."
"587" "Katara" "   What are you doing? !"
"588" "Aang" "   I know, I know.  That was stupid and dangerous."
"589" "Katara" "  Yes, it was."
"590" "Aang" "  The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!"
"591" "Aang" "  I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi."
"592" "Katara" "  Wow.  We don't have cities like this in the South Pole."
"593" "Sokka" "  They have buildings here that don't melt!"
"594" "Aang" "  Well, let's go slow pokes!  The real fun is inside the city!"
"595" "Katara" "  Wait, Aang!  It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar."
"596" "Sokka" "  You need a disguise."
"597" "Aang" "  So, what am I supposed to do?  Grow a mustache?"
"598" "Aang" "  Ohh, this is so itchy!   How do you live in this stuff?"
"599" "Sokka" "  Great!  Now you look just like my grandfather."
"600" "Katara" "  Technically, Aang is 112 years old."
"601" "Aang" "  Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers!  The big city awaits."
"602" "Aang" "  You guys are gonna love Omashu.  The people here are the friendliest in the world."
"603" "Aang" "  Just keep smiling. . ."
"604" "Aang" "  My business is my business, young man, and none of yours!  I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!"
"605" "Aang" "  Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids."
"606" "Katara" "  Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis.  Nice to meet you."
"607" "Katara" "  We will."
"608" "Aang" "  Good idea!"
"609" "Aang" "  This is the Omashu delivery system.  Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.  Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down."
"610" "Sokka" "  Great, so they get their mail on time."
"611" "Aang" "  They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes. . ."
"612" "Aang" "  Umm. . .  the mail system?"
"613" "Aang" "  A package sending system?"
"614" "Aang" "  Bumi, you're a mad genius!"
"615" "Aang" "  One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor."
"616" "Katara" "  This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second thoughts!"
"617" "Aang" "  I'm on it!  I'm on it!"
"618" "Katara" "  Aang, do something!  Use your airbending!"
"619" "Aang" "  Yeh!  Good idea!  That'll make us go even faster!"
"620" "Aang" "  Sorry!"
"621" "Aang" "  Two cabbages please."
"622" "Aang" "  Huh?"
"623" "Aang" "  Thanks, but I don't eat meat."
"624" "Sokka" "  Mmm!"
"625" "Katara" "  Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?"
"626" "Aang" "  I'm from. . .  Kangaroo Island."
"627" "Sokka" "  What?  It was pretty funny."
"628" "Aang" "  Okay!  You caught me.  I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.  Everything checks out , no firebenders here.  So, good work everybody.   Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears.  We'll see you next time!"
"629" "Katara" "  You can't keep us here.  Let us leave."
"630" "Sokka" "  We're in serious trouble.  This guy is nuts."
"631" "Katara" "  This is a prison cell?  But it's so nice."
"632" "Aang" "  He did say it was newly refurbished."
"633" "Sokka" "  Nice or not, we're still prisoners."
"634" "Aang" "  I wonder what these challenges are gonna be."
"635" "Katara" "  We're not sticking around to find out.  There's gotta be some way outta here."
"636" "Aang" "  The air vents!"
"637" "Sokka" "  If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king."
"638" "Aang" "  We can't, but Momo can."
"639" "Aang" "  Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!"
"640" "Aang" "  Go on, boy, get Appa!"
"641" "Sokka" "  Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?"
"642" "Aang" "  Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out."
"643" "Katara" "  Well, no point in arguing about it now.   Get some rest, Aang.  Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow."
"644" "Aang" "  Sokka!  Katara!   Where are my friends?"
"645" "Aang" "  And if I fail?"
"646" "Aang" "  I. . .  guess it's fine."
"647" "Aang" "  Really?"
"648" "Aang" "  I don't have time for your crazy games!  Gimme my friends back!  We're leaving!"
"649" "Sokka" "  Ah!  It's already creeping!"
"650" "Aang" "  I'll do as you want."
"651" "Aang" "  There, enjoy your lunch!  I want my friends back, now!"
"652" "Aang" "  Okay, found him!"
"653" "Aang" "  Come here, Flopsy!"
"654" "Aang" "  Flopsy, wait!  Flopsy!  Flopsy!"
"655" "Aang" "  Flopsy?"
"656" "Aang" "  Flopsy!"
"657" "Aang" "  Guys, are you ok?"
"658" "Katara" "  Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great."
"659" "Aang" "  Come on.  I'm ready for the next challenge."
"660" "Aang" "  So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?"
"661" "Aang" "  I. . .  choose. . .  you!"
"662" "Aang" "  Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?"
"663" "Aang" "  Huh?"
"664" "Aang" "  That's not fair!  You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests."
"665" "Sokka" "  Oh come on!"
"666" "Aang" "  How am I supposed to know his name?"
"667" "Katara" "  Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle."
"668" "Sokka" "  I got it!"
"669" "Aang" "  Yeh?"
"670" "Sokka" "  He's an earthbender, right?  Rocky!   You know, because of all the rocks?"
"671" "Katara" "  We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup."
"672" "Aang" "  Okay, so back to the challenges.  I got a key from the waterfall.  I saved his pet and I had a duel."
"673" "Katara" "  And what did you learn?"
"674" "Aang" "  Well, everything was different than I expected."
"675" "Katara" "  And. . . ?"
"676" "Aang" "  Well, they weren't straightforward.  To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would.   I know his name!"
"677" "Aang" "  I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges.  As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.   Bumi, you're a mad genius!"
"678" "Katara" "  Uh, over here!"
"679" "Sokka" "  Little help?"
"680" "Katara" "  So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?"
"681" "Sokka" "  Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?"
"682" "Aang" "  Thank you for your wisdom.  But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!"
"683" "Aang" "  Great, you're back!  What's for dinner?"
"684" "Sokka" "  We've got a few options.  First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that. . .  might just be rocks.  Dig in!"
"685" "Katara" "  Seriously, what else ya got?"
"686" "Sokka" "  What was that! ?"
"687" "Aang" "  It's coming from over there!"
"688" "Sokka" "  Shouldn't we run away from huge booms –  not toward them?"
"689" "Katara" "  An earthbender!"
"690" "Aang" "  Let's go meet him!"
"691" "Sokka" "  He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously."
"692" "Katara" "  Hello there, I'm Katara!  What's your name?"
"693" "Aang" "  Nice to meet you!"
"694" "Katara" "  We just wanted to say “hi”."
"695" "Aang" "  Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!"
"696" "Katara" "  Which means no nuts for dinner!"
"697" "Sokka" "  Hey!  I worked hard to get those nuts!   Yeh, I hate'em too."
"698" "Aang" "  Great hat.  I'll trade you some nuts for it."
"699" "Katara" "  Hey!"
"700" "Katara" "  Hey, you're that kid!  Why did you run away before?"
"701" "Aang" "  No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending."
"702" "Sokka" "  Fire Nation!  Act natural!"
"703" "Sokka" "  Nice guy.  How long has the Fire Nation been here?"
"704" "Katara" "  But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help."
"705" "Katara" "  How can you say that?  Haru has a gift.  Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.  It's a part of who we are."
"706" "Katara" "  I understand that Haru can help you fight back.  What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?"
"707" "Aang" "  Thanks.  I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay."
"708" "Katara" "  I'm sorry about what I said earlier.  I didn't know about your father."
"709" "Katara" "  thanks."
"710" "Katara" "  He sounds like a great man."
"711" "Katara" "  So, that's why you hide your earthbending?"
"712" "Katara" "  See this necklace?  My mother gave it to me."
"713" "Katara" "  I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid.  This necklace is all I have left of her."
"714" "Katara" "  No."
"715" "Katara" ""
"716" "Katara" "  Haru, there's a way you can help him."
"717" "Katara" "  Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way."
"718" "Katara" "  Haru, you did it!"
"719" "Katara" "  It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man."
"720" "Aang" "  You must have really inspired him."
"721" "Katara" "  I guess so."
"722" "Sokka" "  Everyone should get some sleep.  We're leaving at dawn."
"723" "Katara" "  Dawn?  Can't we sleep in for once?"
"724" "Sokka" "  Absolutely not!  This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops.  If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast.  Good night."
"725" "Katara" "  I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts."
"726" "Sokka" "  Good night."
"727" "Katara" "  They took him!  They took Haru away!"
"728" "Aang" "  What?"
"729" "Katara" "  The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation.  It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending."
"730" "Sokka" "  Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?"
"731" "Katara" "  Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight."
"732" "Sokka" "  Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone."
"733" "Katara" "  We don't need to track him.  The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru."
"734" "Aang" "  . . . and why would they do that?"
"735" "Katara" "  because they're going to arrest me for earthbending."
"736" "Sokka" "  I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.  There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here.  The boulder levitates and –  tada!  Fake earthbending."
"737" "Katara" "  Aang.  Did you get all that?"
"738" "Aang" "  Sure, I got it."
"739" "Sokka" "  Do you remember your cue?"
"740" "Aang" "  Yeh, yeh, just relax.  You're taking all the fun out of this."
"741" "Sokka" "  By “this” do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of ruthless firebenders?"
"742" "Aang" "  Exactly!  That's fun stuff."
"743" "Sokka" "  Here they come!  Get in your places!"
"744" "Sokka" "  Get out of my way, pipsqueak!"
"745" "Katara" "  How dare you call me “pipsqueak” you giant- eared cretin!"
"746" "Sokka" "  What did you call me?"
"747" "Katara" "  A giant- eared cretin!  Look at those things.   Do herds of animals use them for shade?"
"748" "Sokka" "  You better back off!   Seriously –  back off."
"749" "Katara" "  I will not back off!  I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!"
"750" "Sokka" "  That's it –  you're going down!"
"751" "Katara" "  I'll show you who's boss –  earthbending style!"
"752" "Katara" "  I said, “earthbending style!"
"753" "Sokka" "  No, you idiot!  It's the girl!"
"754" "Sokka" "  I'll hold her!   You've got 12 hours to find Haru, we'll be right behind you."
"755" "Sokka" "  Momo, you have some big ears!"
"756" "Sokka" "  She'll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she's doing."
"757" "Katara" "  Haru!"
"758" "Katara" "  It's my fault you were captured.  I came to rescue you."
"759" "Katara" "  It was the only way to find you."
"760" "Katara" "  It's an honor to meet you."
"761" "Katara" "  Eruhh!"
"762" "Katara" "  Erahh!"
"763" "Katara" "  If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?"
"764" "Katara" "  You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig?  What is it?  Mutiny?  Sabotage?"
"765" "Katara" "  How can you say that?  You sound like you've already given up."
"766" "Katara" "  We'll see about that."
"767" "Katara" "  Earthbenders!  You don't know me, but I know of you.  Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.   Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.  Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear!  Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home.  It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.  The time to fight back is now!  I can tell you the Avatar has returned!  So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!"
"768" "Sokka" "  Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru?  We've got to get out of here."
"769" "Katara" "  I can't."
"770" "Sokka" "  We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere.  Get on."
"771" "Aang" "  Katara, what's wrong?"
"772" "Katara" "  I'm not leaving.  I'm not giving up on these people."
"773" "Katara" "  We can't abandon these people.  There has to be a way to help them."
"774" "Aang" "  Maybe she's right.  What do you say, Sokka?"
"775" "Sokka" "  I say you're both crazy!   Last chance, we need to leave –  now!"
"776" "Katara" "  No."
"777" "Sokka" "  I hate when you get like this.  .  Come on, we better hide."
"778" "Sokka" "  We don't have much time.  What are we gonna do?"
"779" "Aang" "  I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.   The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!"
"780" "Sokka" "  Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?"
"781" "Aang" "  I'm just tossing ideas around."
"782" "Katara" "  I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work.  If there was just a way to help them help themselves."
"783" "Sokka" "  For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. . .  something they can bend."
"784" "Katara" "  But this entire place is made of metal."
"785" "Aang" "  No, it's not.  Look at the smoke.  I bet they're burning coal –  In other words, earth."
"786" "Katara" "  It's almost dawn, we're running out of time!  Are you sure this is gonna work?"
"787" "Sokka" "  It should.  These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.  We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale."
"788" "Sokka" "  There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated.  Aang closed off all the vents except one.  When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go –  right back here."
"789" "Sokka" "  Stay back, I'm warning you!"
"790" "Katara" "  Here's your chance, earthbenders!   Take it!  Your fate is in your own hands!"
"791" "Aang" "  Guys, throw me some coal!"
"792" "Katara" "  All it took was a little coal."
"793" "Katara" "  So, I guess you're going home now?"
"794" "Katara" "  I can't.  Your mission is to take back your home.  Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole."
"795" "Katara" "  I know.   My mother's necklace!  It's gone!"
"796" "Katara" "  Those clouds look so soft, don't they?  Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap."
"797" "Sokka" "  Maybe you should give it a try."
"798" "Katara" "  You're hilarious."
"799" "Aang" "  I'll try it!  Yehhhh!"
"800" "Aang" "  Turns out clouds are made of water!"
"801" "Katara" "  Hey, what is that?"
"802" "Sokka" "  It's like a scar."
"803" "Sokka" "  Listen, it's so quiet.  There's no life anywhere."
"804" "Katara" "  Aang, are you ok?"
"805" "Sokka" "  Fire Nation!  Those evil savages make me sick!  They have no respect for –"
"806" "Katara" "  Shh!"
"807" "Sokka" "  What?  I'm not allowed to be angry?"
"808" "Aang" "  Why would anyone do this?  How could I let this happen?"
"809" "Katara" "  Aang, you didn't let this happen.  It has nothing to do with you."
"810" "Aang" "  Yes it does.  It's the Avatar's job to protect nature.  But, I don't know how to do my job."
"811" "Katara" "  That's why we're going to the North Pole to find you a teacher."
"812" "Aang" "  Yeh, a waterbending teacher, but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.  Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me."
"813" "Sokka" "  The Avatar before you?  He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?"
"814" "Aang" "  I don't know."
"815" "Zuko" "  Uncle!  It's time to leave!  Where are you?  Uncle Iroh!"
"816" "Zuko" "  Uncle?  We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!"
"817" "Iroh" "  You look tired, Prince Zuko.  Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles."
"818" "Zuko" "  My troubles cannot be soaked away.  It's time to go!"
"819" "Iroh" "  You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little.  The temperature's just right.  I heated it myself."
"820" "Zuko" "  Enough!  We need to leave now!  Get out of the water!"
"821" "Iroh" "  Very well."
"822" "Zuko" "  On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes, but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you."
"823" "Iroh" "  Ahhhh!"
"824" "Katara" "  Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?"
"825" "Aang" "  No."
"826" "Aang" "  Ow!"
"827" "Aang" "  Hey, how was that cheering me up?"
"828" "Sokka" "  Hehe, cheered me up."
"829" "Sokka" "  Ow!  Yeh, I probably deserved that."
"830" "Katara" "  These acorns are everywhere, Aang.  That means the forest will grow back.  Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back."
"831" "Aang" "  Thanks, Katara."
"832" "Sokka" "  Hey, who are you?"
"833" "Aang" "  Nice to meet you too.  .  So. . . is there something I can help you with?"
"834" "Sokka" "  Why is it attacking you?"
"835" "Katara" "  What happens then?"
"836" "Aang" "  So, what do you want me to do exactly?"
"837" "Aang" "  Right. . . that's me."
"838" "Katara" "  Hey, ‘great bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second?"
"839" "Katara" "  Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this."
"840" "Aang" "  Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.   It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!"
"841" "Katara" "  So, can you help these people?"
"842" "Aang" "  I have to try, don't I?  Maybe whatever I have to do will just. . .  come to me."
"843" "Katara" "  I think you can do it, Aang."
"844" "Sokka" "  Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster."
"845" "Iroh" "  Uh?  Who's there?"
"846" "Iroh" "  A meadow vole!  I should have known.  You startled me, little one.   Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap."
"847" "Aang" "  Hello?  Spirit, can you hear me?  This is the Avatar speaking.  I'm. . .  here to try to help stuff."
"848" "Sokka" "  This isn't right.  We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up."
"849" "Sokka" "  He still shouldn't have to face this alone."
"850" "Aang" "  The sun has set.  Where are you, Hei- Bai?  Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!"
"851" "Aang" "  Okay.  Well, I guess that's settled then."
"852" "Aang" "  You must be the Hei- Bai spirit.   My name is. . ."
"853" "Aang" "  My name is Aang!  I'm the Avatar and I would like to help!  Hey, wait up!"
"854" "Aang" "  Uh. . ."
"855" "Sokka" "  It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying.  Maybe we should go help him?"
"856" "Katara" "  Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka."
"857" "Aang" "  Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?"
"858" "Aang" "  I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge.  Excuse me, would you please turn around?  I command you to turn around now!"
"859" "Sokka" "  That's it!  He needs help!"
"860" "Katara" "  Sokka wait!"
"861" "Sokka" "  Hei- Bai!  Over here!"
"862" "Aang" "  Sokka, go back!"
"863" "Sokka" "  We'll fight him together, Aang."
"864" "Aang" "  I don't wanna fight him unless I –  huh!"
"865" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"866" "Zuko" "  Uncle!  Uncle, where are you?"
"867" "Zuko" "  Something's not right here.   That pile of rocks. . ."
"868" "Zuko" "  Land doesn't slide uphill.  Those rocks didn't move naturally.  My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!"
"869" "Sokka" "  Aang, over here!"
"870" "Sokka" "  Help!"
"871" "Aang" "  Hang on, Sokka!"
"872" "Aang" "  Sokka!   I failed."
"873" "Iroh" "  Where are you taking me?"
"874" "Iroh" "  Right.  But where, specifically?"
"875" "Iroh" "  Ah!  The great city of Ba- Sing- Se."
"876" "Iroh" "  I acknowledged my defeat at Ba- Sing- Se!  After 600 days away from home, my men were tired and I was tired,  and I'm still tired."
"877" "Katara" "  I know."
"878" "Katara" "  Everything's gonna be okay."
"879" "Aang" "  Katara, Katara I lost him."
"880" "Aang" "  What?  No, I'm right here!  Grrr! ! !"
"881" "Aang" "  I'm in the spirit world!"
"882" "Zuko" "  Yup, that's Uncle Iroh."
"883" "Aang" "  I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise.  Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right?  All I have to do is. . .  figure out what I have to do.  But once I do that, no problem!"
"884" "Aang" "  Appa!  Hey buddy, I'm right here.  But, I guess you can't see me either."
"885" "Katara" "  It's ok, Appa.  I'm sure they're on their way back.  I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat."
"886" "Aang" "  What am I supposed to do?"
"887" "Aang" "  Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?"
"888" "Aang" "  Sokka?"
"889" "Aang" "  That's definitely not Sokka!"
"890" "Aang" "  What?  I can't airbend in the spirit world!"
"891" "Aang" "  You're Avatar Roku's animal guide!  Like Appa is to me.  I need to save my friend and I don't know how.  Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?"
"892" "Aang" "  I'll be back Katara.   Take me to Roku!"
"893" "Iroh" "  Nothing.  Actually, there is a bit of a problem.  My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose."
"894" "Iroh" "  That's right.  The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists.  It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much."
"895" "Aang" "  Hey, what are you doing! ?  Ahhhh! ! !"
"896" "Aang" "  I don't understand.  This is just a statue of Roku."
"897" "Aang" "  Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about?  A comet?  When can I talk to him?"
"898" "Aang" "  It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!   So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?   But I can't wait that long.  I need to save Sokka now."
"899" "Katara" "  It's no use, Appa.  I don't see them anywhere.  Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait."
"900" "Zuko" "  The Avatar!"
"901" "Katara" "  You're back!  Where's Sokka?"
"902" "Aang" "  I'm not sure."
"903" "Iroh" "  Excellent form, Prince Zuko."
"904" "Zuko" "  You taught me well."
"905" "Iroh" "  Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!"
"906" "Zuko" "  Now would you please put on some clothes!"
"907" "Katara" "  Aang, what are you doing?  Run!"
"908" "Aang" "  You're the spirit of this forest.  Now I understand.  You're upset and angry because your home was burned down.  When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset.  But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back."
"909" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"910" "Sokka" "  What happened?"
"911" "Katara" "  You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours.  How are you feeling?"
"912" "Sokka" "  Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!"
"913" "Sokka" "  You could give us some supplies and some money."
"914" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"915" "Sokka" "  What?  We need stuff."
"916" "Katara" "  I'm so proud of you, Aang.  You figured out what to do all on your own."
"917" "Aang" "  Actually, I did have a little help.  And there's something else."
"918" "Sokka" "  What is it?"
"919" "Aang" "  I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit."
"920" "Katara" "  That's great!"
"921" "Sokka" "  Creepy, but great."
"922" "Aang" "  There's a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him."
"923" "Katara" "  But, the solstice is tomorrow."
"924" "Aang" "  Yeh, and there's one more problem.  The island is in the Fire Nation."
"925" "Aang" "  Let's go Appa!  Come on, boy!"
"926" "Sokka" "  I think his big butt is trying to tell you something."
"927" "Katara" "  Please don't go, Aang.  The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation.  Neither can I."
"928" "Aang" "  But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means.  I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice.  That's today."
"929" "Katara" "  We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang."
"930" "Sokka" "  At least not without your friends.  We got your back."
"931" "Sokka" ""
"932" "Aang" "  Thank you, for your. . ."
"933" "Zuko" "  Having trouble sleeping?   Seen the Avatar lately?"
"934" "Aang" "  Come on, boy!  We've got a long way to go!  Faster!"
"935" "Iroh" "  Sailing into Fire Nation waters. . .  of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish."
"936" "Zuko" "  I have no choice, Uncle."
"937" "Iroh" "  Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? ! ? ! ?   What if you're caught?"
"938" "Zuko" "  I'm chasing the Avatar.  My father will understand why I'm returning home."
"939" "Iroh" "  You give him too much credit.  My brother is not the understanding type."
"940" "Zuko" "  There they are!  Helmsman, full steam ahead!"
"941" "Katara" "  Aang, we got trouble."
"942" "Sokka" "  Yeah, and its gaining fast!"
"943" "Iroh" "  Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?"
"944" "Zuko" "  On my mark. . . . . . . . . Fire!"
"945" "Katara" "  Fire ball!"
"946" "Aang" "  I'm on it!"
"947" "Katara" "  We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!"
"948" "Sokka" "  Can't you make Appa go any faster?"
"949" "Aang" "  Yeah, but there's just one little problem."
"950" "Zuko" "  A blockade!"
"951" "Iroh" "  Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.  Turn back now and they cannot arrest you."
"952" "Aang" "  If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade.  It's the only way."
"953" "Katara" "  There's no time."
"954" "Aang" "  This is exactly why I didn't want you to come.  Its too dangerous."
"955" "Katara" "  And that's exactly why we're here."
"956" "Sokka" "  Let's run this blockade."
"957" "Aang" "  Appa!  Yip!  Yip!"
"958" "Zuko" "  He's not turning around."
"959" "Iroh" "  Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do.  Do not follow the Avatar."
"960" "Zuko" "  I'm sorry, Uncle.   Run the blockade!"
"961" "Aang" "  Appa!  Are you ok?"
"962" "Zuko" "  Do not stop this ship."
"963" "Aang" "  We made it! ! !"
"964" "Sokka" "  We got into the Fire Nation. . . . . . . . . Great. . ."
"965" "Iroh" "  We're on a collision course!"
"966" "Zuko" "  We can make it!"
"967" "Aang" "  There it is!  The island Roku's dragon took me to!"
"968" "Aang" "  You did it buddy.  Nice flying."
"969" "Katara" "  Oh!  You must be tired! Sokka  No.   I'm good.   Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders."
"970" "Katara" "  I was talking to Appa."
"971" "Sokka" "  Well, I was talking to Momo."
"972" "Sokka" "  I don't see any guards."
"973" "Katara" "  The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died."
"974" "Aang" "  Its almost sundown.  We'd better hurry."
"975" "Sokka" "  Wait. . . . . . I think I heard something."
"976" "Aang" "  Great!  I am the Avatar."
"977" "Aang" "  I'll hold them off.  Run!"
"978" "Aang" "  Follow me!"
"979" "Sokka" "  Do you know where you're going?"
"980" "Aang" "  Nope!   Wrong way!"
"981" "Sokka" "  Firebenders aren't our friends."
"982" "Aang" "  You do?"
"983" "Aang" "  How?"
"984" "Zuko" "  What's he up to, Uncle?  Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?"
"985" "Iroh" "  Because he wants to follow you.  He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after. . . the Avatar."
"986" "Zuko" "  If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do."
"987" "Aang" "  Did you know Avatar Roku?"
"988" "Aang" "  Is that how you knew I was coming?"
"989" "Katara" "  That's when we were at the Air Temple.  Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!"
"990" "Aang" "  If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?"
"991" "Aang" "  They were waiting for me."
"992" "Sokka" "  Hey, don't feel bad.  You're only a hundred years late."
"993" "Aang" "  Thank you for helping me."
"994" "Aang" "  Shyu, what's wrong?"
"995" "Katara" "  Can't you just open them with firebending?  Like you opened that other door?"
"996" "Sokka" "  Five fire blasts, huh?   I think I can help you out."
"997" "Zuko" "  Uncle, keep heading north.  Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover."
"998" "Iroh" ""
"999" "Katara" "  You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka."
"1000" "Katara" "  Its almost sunset.  Are you ready?"
"1001" "Aang" "  Definitely."
"1002" "Aang" "  They're still locked."
"1003" "Katara" "  Aang, stop!  There's nothing else we can do."
"1004" "Aang" "  I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing."
"1005" "Sokka" "  I don't get it.  That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen."
"1006" "Katara" "  Sokka!  You're a genius!"
"1007" "Aang" "  Wait, how is Sokka genius?  His plan didn't even work."
"1008" "Sokka" "  Come on Aang, let her dream."
"1009" "Katara" "  You're right.  Sokka's plan didn't work. . . but it looks like it did."
"1010" "Aang" "  Did the definition of “genius” change in the last hundred years?"
"1011" "Katara" "  Aang!  Now's your chance!"
"1012" "Zuko" "  The Avatar's coming with me!"
"1013" "Zuko" "  Close the doors!  Quickly!"
"1014" "Katara" "  Go!"
"1015" "Katara" "  He made it!"
"1016" "Aang" "  The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku.  So why isn't anything happening?"
"1017" "Zuko" "  Why isn't it working?  It's sealed shut!"
"1018" "Aang" "  Why isn't anything happening?  I don't know what I'm doing!  All I know is airbending!  Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!"
"1019" "Zuko" "  Why did you help the Avatar?"
"1020" "Zuko" "  You're too late, Zhao.  The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed."
"1021" "Aang" "  Is it about that vision?  The one with the comet?"
"1022" "Aang" "  What does it mean?"
"1023" "Aang" "  So the comet made them stronger?"
"1024" "Aang" "  But that happened a hundred years ago.  What does the comet have to do with the war now?"
"1025" "Aang" "  But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire."
"1026" "Katara" "  How's Aang going to make it out of this?"
"1027" "Sokka" "  How're we going to make it out of this?"
"1028" "Aang" "  What if I can't master all the elements in time?  What if I fail?"
"1029" "Aang" "  But I won't be able to come back to the temple.  What if I have questions?  How will I talk to you?"
"1030" "Aang" "  I'm ready."
"1031" "Katara" "  No!  Aang!"
"1032" "Katara" "  Not without Aang!"
"1033" "Sokka" "  We got your back."
"1034" "Aang" "  Thanks.  Where's Shyu?"
"1035" "Katara" "  I don't know."
"1036" "Sokka" "  Would you sit down?  If we hit a bump you'll go flying off!  What's bugging you anyway?"
"1037" "Aang" "  It's what Avatar Roku said.  I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives."
"1038" "Sokka" "  Well, let's see, you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years. . .  I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer."
"1039" "Aang" "  I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole!  What am I gonna do! ?"
"1040" "Katara" "  Calm down.  It's going to be okay.  If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know."
"1041" "Aang" "  You'd do that?"
"1042" "Katara" "  We'll need to find a good source of water first."
"1043" "Sokka" "  Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in."
"1044" "Sokka" "  Nice puddle."
"1045" "Aang" "  Yehhh!  Don't start without me, boy!"
"1046" "Katara" "  Remember the reason we're here."
"1047" "Aang" "  Oh right, time to practice waterbending."
"1048" "Sokka" "  Great.  So what am I supposed to do?"
"1049" "Aang" "  You could. . .  clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?"
"1050" "Sokka" "  So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?"
"1051" "Aang" "  Mud and bugs!"
"1052" "Sokka" "  Okay."
"1053" "Zuko" "  Someone's changing our course!"
"1054" "Zuko" "  What's the meaning of this mutiny?  No one told you to change course!"
"1055" "Iroh" "  Actually, someone did.  I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko."
"1056" "Zuko" "  Is it something to do with the Avatar?"
"1057" "Iroh" "  Even more urgent.  It seems. . .  I've lost my lotus tile."
"1058" "Zuko" "  Lotus tile?"
"1059" "Iroh" "  For my Pai Sho game.  Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ."
"1060" "Zuko" "  You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?"
"1061" "Iroh" "  See, you, like most people, underestimate its value.  Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.  Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!"
"1062" "Iroh" "  I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew."
"1063" "Sokka" "  Yeh, don't get too happy.  You gotta do me next."
"1064" "Katara" "  This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away.  Just push and pull the water like this. . ."
"1065" "Katara" "  The key is getting the wrist movement right."
"1066" "Aang" "  Like this?"
"1067" "Katara" "  That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually –"
"1068" "Aang" "  Hey, I'm bending it already!"
"1069" "Katara" "  Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.   It took me two months to learn that move."
"1070" "Aang" "  Well, you had to figure it out on your own.  I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher."
"1071" "Katara" "  Thanks."
"1072" "Aang" "  So, what's next."
"1073" "Katara" "  This is a more difficult move.  I call it streaming the water."
"1074" "Katara" "  It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if. . ."
"1075" "Katara" "  Nice work, though the over- the- head flare was unnecessary."
"1076" "Aang" "  Sorry.  Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!"
"1077" "Katara" "  Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.  I haven't even totally figured it out yet.  The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. . ."
"1078" "Aang" "  So, like this?"
"1079" "Sokka" "  Aang!"
"1080" "Aang" "  Looks like I got the hang of that move!  What else ya got?"
"1081" "Katara" "  That's enough practicing for today."
"1082" "Sokka" "  Yeh, I'll say!   You just practiced our supplies down the river!"
"1083" "Aang" "  Uhhh. . .  sorry.  I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff."
"1084" "Sokka" "  Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender."
"1085" "Sokka" "  We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.  Let's spend it wisely."
"1086" "Aang" "  Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka.  I couldn't say no to this whistle!"
"1087" "Sokka" "  It doesn't even work.   See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk."
"1088" "Katara" "  No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on."
"1089" "Aang" "  Sure!  What are curios?"
"1090" "Aang" "  Momo's not for sale."
"1091" "Katara" "  Look at this, Aang!  It's a waterbending scroll.  Check out these crazy moves!"
"1092" "Aang" "  Where did you get a waterbending scroll?"
"1093" "Sokka" "  Waaait a minute. . . sea- loving traders. . . with suspiciously acquired merchandise. . . and pet reptile birds. . . You guys are pirates!"
"1094" "Katara" "  So, how much for the, uh, traded scroll?"
"1095" "Aang" "  I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.  .  Watch and learn.  Aang walks over the Pirate Captain. ) What say to the price of. . .  one copper piece!"
"1096" "Aang" "  Okay –  two copper pieces!"
"1097" "Katara" "  Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks."
"1098" "Aang" "  Aye, we be castin' off now!"
"1099" "Aang" "  What was that all about, Katara."
"1100" "Sokka" "  Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection."
"1101" "Katara" "  I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here."
"1102" "Aang" "  Well, well, look who's come to their senses.  Told ya the haggling would pay off."
"1103" "Aang" "  No thanks!"
"1104" "Aang" "  Hold on tight!"
"1105" "Katara" "  Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!"
"1106" "Aang" "  Just hang on!"
"1107" "Aang" "  I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible."
"1108" "Katara" "  I know, that's why I took –  this!"
"1109" "Aang" "  No way."
"1110" "Katara" "  Isn't it great?"
"1111" "Sokka" "  No wonder they were trying to hack us up.  You stole their waterbending scroll."
"1112" "Katara" "  I prefer to think of it as high- risk trading."
"1113" "Aang" "  Haha!  Good one, Katara."
"1114" "Katara" "  Sokka, where do you think they got it?  They stole it from a waterbender."
"1115" "Sokka" "  It doesn't matter.  You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!"
"1116" "Katara" "  These are real waterbending forms.  You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending."
"1117" "Sokka" "  Whatever."
"1118" "Aang" "  Well, what's done is done.  We have it.  We might as well learn from it."
"1119" "Iroh" "  I've checked all the shops on this pier.  Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace."
"1120" "Zuko" "  It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!"
"1121" "Iroh" "  Quite the contrary.  I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for, is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!"
"1122" "Zuko" "  You bought a sumki horn?"
"1123" "Iroh" "  For music night on the ship.  Now, if we only had some woodwinds."
"1124" "Iroh" "  This place looks promising!"
"1125" "Iroh" "  Ooo!  That is handsome!  Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?"
"1126" "Zuko" "  This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?"
"1127" "Katara" "  I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours."
"1128" "Katara" "  The single water whip. . .  looks doable."
"1129" "Katara" "  What's so funny?"
"1130" "Sokka" "  I'm sorry, but you deserve that.   You've been duped.  She's only interested in teaching herself."
"1131" "Katara" "  Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!"
"1132" "Katara" "  Why can't I get this stupid move!"
"1133" "Aang" "  You'll get it."
"1134" "Aang" "  You just gotta shift your weight through the stances. . .   There.  See, the key to bending is. . ."
"1135" "Katara" "  Will you PLEASE shut your air hole!  Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes.  Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!   What?"
"1136" "Katara" "  Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry.  I don't know what came over me.  But, you know what, it won't happen again.   Here, this is yours.  I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore."
"1137" "Aang" ""
"1138" "Katara" "  I'm sorry Momo."
"1139" "Sokka" "  And. . .  what about me?  There was that time you –"
"1140" "Katara" "  No more apologies!"
"1141" "Zuko" "  We don't need to stop.  They stole a waterbending scroll, right?"
"1142" "Zuko" "  Then they'll be on the water."
"1143" "Katara" "  Shh!  Momo, go back to sleep."
"1144" "Katara" "  Shoot!  Come on water, work with me here!"
"1145" "Katara" "  Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances. . . . . . ugh!"
"1146" "Katara" "  No, let go of me!"
"1147" "Zuko" "  I'll save you from the pirates."
"1148" "Katara" "  Go jump in the river!"
"1149" "Zuko" "  Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost.  My honor.  Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost."
"1150" "Katara" "  My mother's necklace!  How did you get that?"
"1151" "Zuko" "  I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering.  Tell me where he is."
"1152" "Katara" "  No!"
"1153" "Zuko" "  I wonder how much money this is worth?  .  A lot, apparently.  Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy.  Search the woods for the boy and meet back here."
"1154" "Sokka" "  Huh?  Where did she go?   I don't believe it."
"1155" "Aang" "  What's wrong."
"1156" "Sokka" "  She took the scroll!  She's obsessed with that thing.  It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep –"
"1157" "Sokka" "  Oh, what?  I'm not good enough to kidnap?"
"1158" "Zuko" "  Nice work."
"1159" "Katara" "  Aang, this is all my fault."
"1160" "Aang" "  No, Katara it isn't."
"1161" "Iroh" "  Yeh, it kind of is."
"1162" "Zuko" "  Give me the boy."
"1163" "Sokka" "  You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment! ?"
"1164" "Zuko" "  Don't listen to him!  He's trying to turn us against each other."
"1165" "Sokka" "  Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll."
"1166" "Zuko" "  Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!"
"1167" "Aang" "  Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth. . ."
"1168" "Sokka" "  I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense.  Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.  You guys would be set for life!"
"1169" "Zuko" "  You'll regret breaking a deal with me!"
"1170" "Katara" "  Thanks, Momo.  I owe you a bushel of apples."
"1171" "Sokka" "  Aang, are you there?"
"1172" "Aang" "  I'm over here, follow my voice!"
"1173" "Sokka" "  Where?  I can't find you!"
"1174" "Aang" "  I'm right here!"
"1175" "Aang" "  Uhh, never mind!  I'll find you!"
"1176" "Aang" "  Run!"
"1177" "Aang" "  Katara!  You're okay!"
"1178" "Katara" "  Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!"
"1179" "Sokka" "  We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship."
"1180" "Aang" "  A team of rhinos. . .  or two waterbenders."
"1181" "Katara" "  Everybody in!"
"1182" "Iroh" "  Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?"
"1183" "Zuko" "  We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!"
"1184" "Iroh" "  It's no proverb."
"1185" "Zuko" "  Haha!"
"1186" "Zuko" "  Hey!  That's my boat!"
"1187" "Iroh" "  Maybe it should be a proverb."
"1188" "Zuko" "  Come on, Uncle!"
"1189" "Aang" "  Sokka!  Can't you make it go any faster? ."
"1190" "Sokka" "  I don't know how.  This thing wasn't made by the water tribe."
"1191" "Aang" "  Hey, you did the water whip!"
"1192" "Katara" "  I couldn't have done it without your help!"
"1193" "Sokka" "  Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!"
"1194" "Katara" "  Aang, look!"
"1195" "Aang" "  Oh, no!"
"1196" "Sokka" "  Have you lost your mind! ?  This is no time for flute practice!"
"1197" "Katara" "  We can stop the boat!  Aang, together, push and pull the water!"
"1198" "Katara" "  It's working!  It's slowing down!"
"1199" "Katara" "  We're doing it!"
"1200" "Sokka" "  But we have another problem!"
"1201" "Aang" "  I knew a bison whistle would come in handy.  Thanks, Appa."
"1202" "Sokka" "  Yeh, we owe ya one."
"1203" "Zuko" "  My boat!"
"1204" "Iroh" "  Hehe, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.  The missing lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!"
"1205" "Katara" "  Aang, I still owe you an apology.   You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.  I got so competitive that I put us all in danger.  I'm sorry."
"1206" "Aang" "  That's okay, Katara."
"1207" "Katara" "  Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway."
"1208" "Sokka" "  Is that really how you feel?"
"1209" "Katara" "  The scroll!"
"1210" "Sokka" "  First, what did you learn?"
"1211" "Katara" "  Stealing is wrong.   Unless it's from pirates!"
"1212" "Aang" "  Haha!  Good one, Katara."
"1213" "Aang" "  Where's Momo?"
"1214" "Aang" "  Hang on Momo!"
"1215" "Aang" "  All right— you too."
"1216" "Sokka" "  This is gonna take forever."
"1217" "Aang" "  That works. . ."
"1218" "Sokka" "  These are Fire Nation traps— you can tell from the metalwork.  We'd better pack up camp, and get moving."
"1219" "Sokka" "  Ah- ah. . . no flying this time."
"1220" "Katara" "  What?"
"1221" "Aang" "  Why wouldn't we fly?"
"1222" "Sokka" "  Think about it.  Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us.  It's because they spot Appa— he's just too noticeable."
"1223" "Katara" "  What!  Appa's not too noticeable!"
"1224" "Sokka" "  He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head— it's kinda hard to miss him!"
"1225" "Aang" "  Sokka's just jealous ‘cause he doesn't have an arrow."
"1226" "Sokka" "  I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk."
"1227" "Katara" "  Who made you the boss?"
"1228" "Sokka" "  I'm not the boss— I'm the leader."
"1229" "Katara" "  You're the leader?  But your voice still cracks!"
"1230" "Sokka" "  I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior.   So. . . I'm the leader!"
"1231" "Katara" "  If anyone's the leader, it's Aang.  I mean, he is the Avatar."
"1232" "Sokka" "  Are you kidding— he's just a goofy kid!"
"1233" "Aang" "  He's right."
"1234" "Katara" "  Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader?  I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl."
"1235" "Sokka" "  I- I've kissed a girl— you. . . just haven't met her."
"1236" "Katara" "  Who?  Gran- gran?  I've met Gran- gran."
"1237" "Sokka" "  No— besides Gran- gran.  Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts."
"1238" "Katara" "  Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader."
"1239" "Aang" "  Who knows— walking might be fun."
"1240" "Aang" "  Walking stinks!  How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?"
"1241" "Katara" "  I don't know Aang.  Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts— they seem to know everything."
"1242" "Sokka" "  Ha ha.  Very funny."
"1243" "Aang" "  I'm tired of carrying this pack."
"1244" "Katara" "  You know who you should ask to carry it for a while?  Sokka's Instincts!"
"1245" "Aang" "  That's a great idea!  Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind—"
"1246" "Sokka" "  Okay, okay— I get it.  Look guys, I'm tired too.  But the important thing is that- -   - - we're safe from. . . the—   - - Fire. . . Nation. . ."
"1247" "Sokka" "  RUN!"
"1248" "Sokka" "  We're cut off!"
"1249" "Aang" "  Sokka, your shirt!"
"1250" "Sokka" "  If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you."
"1251" "Katara" "  What are you doing?"
"1252" "Sokka" "  Bluffing?"
"1253" "Aang" "  Nice work, Sokka!  How'd ya do that?"
"1254" "Sokka" "  Uh. . . instinct?"
"1255" "Katara" "  Look!  are mismatched.  He has a shaggy mane of brown hair, and a twig held in his teeth. He rushes forward, his shuang gou  in each hand.  He hooks a leg each on another pair of soldiers and sends them head over heels.  With a polished body flip, he launches them through the air.  They end up in a heap on top of their prone captain. Jet lands on his feet, ready for more."
"1256" "Sokka" "  Man!"
"1257" "Katara" "  Hi."
"1258" "Aang" "  You just took out a whole army almost single- handed!"
"1259" "Sokka" "  Army?  Pfft.  There were only, like, twenty guys!"
"1260" "Aang" "  Pipsqueak— that's a funny name."
"1261" "Aang" "  It's hilarious.   or investigating supply crates .  Sokka watches as Smellerbee passes him with an armful of staves. Jet is reclining against the trunk of a tree on the perimeter of the camp.  Katara approaches."
"1262" "Katara" "  We were relying on instincts."
"1263" "Aang" "  You guys have a hideout?"
"1264" "Katara" "  Yes we wanna see it!"
"1265" "Sokka" "  Where. . . there's nothing here!"
"1266" "Sokka" "  Why. . . what's this do?"
"1267" "Sokka" "  Woah!"
"1268" "Aang" "  I'll get up on my own."
"1269" "Aang" "  Nice place you got!"
"1270" "Katara" "  It's beautiful up here!"
"1271" "Katara" "  Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?"
"1272" "Katara" "  That's so brave."
"1273" "Sokka" "  Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse."
"1274" "Katara" "  Don't pay any attention to my brother."
"1275" "Katara" "  So, you all live here?"
"1276" "Katara" "  What about you?"
"1277" "Katara" "  Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation."
"1278" "Katara" "  Hey Jet, nice speech."
"1279" "Katara" "  Well, he's great.  He's the Avatar.  I could use some more training."
"1280" "Aang" "  Thanks Jet."
"1281" "Sokka" "  Unfortunately we have to leave tonight."
"1282" "Sokka" "  What mission?"
"1283" "Sokka" "  Shh. . . it amplifies vibrations."
"1284" "Sokka" "  Nothing yet.   Wait!  Yes, someone's approaching."
"1285" "Sokka" "  I think there's just one."
"1286" "Sokka" "  Wait!  False alarm. . . he's just an old man."
"1287" "Sokka" "  Jet, he's just an old man!"
"1288" "Sokka" "  But he's not hurting anyone!"
"1289" "Sokka" "  This doesn't feel right."
"1290" "Aang" "  Sokka!  Look what the Duke gave me!"
"1291" "Aang" "  Ow!  Quit it!"
"1292" "Katara" "  Hey Sokka.  Is Jet back?"
"1293" "Sokka" "  Yeah— he's back.  But we're leaving."
"1294" "Aang" "  What?"
"1295" "Katara" "  But I made him this hat."
"1296" "Sokka" "  Your boyfriend Jet's a thug."
"1297" "Katara" "  What?  No, he's not."
"1298" "Sokka" "  He's messed up Katara."
"1299" "Aang" "  He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life— a really fun way of life."
"1300" "Sokka" "  He beat and robbed a harmless old man!"
"1301" "Katara" "  I wanna hear Jet's side of the story."
"1302" "Katara" "  No, he conveniently left that part out."
"1303" "Sokka" "  Fine!"
"1304" "Katara" ""
"1305" "Katara" "  See Sokka?  I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife."
"1306" "Sokka" "  There was no knife!  I'm going back to the hut and packing my things."
"1307" "Aang" "  What can we do?"
"1308" "Katara" "  We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!"
"1309" "Sokka" "  I'm sorry Katara.  Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him."
"1310" "Katara" "  You know what I think?  You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!"
"1311" "Sokka" "  Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet.  It's just that my instinct—"
"1312" "Katara" "  Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet.  Come on Aang."
"1313" "Aang" "  Sorry Sokka."
"1314" "Sokka" "  I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town."
"1315" "Sokka" "  There are people living there Jet— mothers and fathers and children."
"1316" "Sokka" "  You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!"
"1317" "Sokka" "  I do understand.  I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want."
"1318" "Sokka" "  You can't do this!"
"1319" "Katara" "  Jet— I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting."
"1320" "Aang" "  Really?   Sokka apologized?"
"1321" "Katara" "  Yeah, I did."
"1322" "Katara" "  I'm glad he cooled off.  He's so stubborn sometimes."
"1323" "Katara" "  . . . I've never used bending on water I can't see.  I don't know. . ."
"1324" "Aang" "  What about me?"
"1325" "Aang" "  Look, there's another steam vent."
"1326" "Katara" "  When we're done we'll meet you over there."
"1327" "Aang" "  . . . I bet that's enough— and I'm not just saying that to be lazy."
"1328" "Katara" "  Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir."
"1329" "Aang" "  I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout."
"1330" "Katara" "  Well, we finished early- - I'm sure he'll be happy to see us."
"1331" "Sokka" "  How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?"
"1332" "Sokka" "  If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn."
"1333" "Sokka" "  While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot- work."
"1334" "Katara" "  . . . What are they doing?"
"1335" "Aang" "  Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation."
"1336" "Katara" "  Why would they need blasting jelly?"
"1337" "Aang" "  Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam."
"1338" "Katara" "  What?  No- - that would destroy the town.  Jet wouldn't do that."
"1339" "Aang" "  I've gotta stop him."
"1340" "Katara" "  Jet wouldn't do that."
"1341" "Katara" "  Jet— why?"
"1342" "Katara" "  This isn't the answer!"
"1343" "Katara" "  Where's Sokka?"
"1344" "Aang" "  I need to get to the dam."
"1345" "Aang" "  I'm not gonna fight you, Jet."
"1346" "Katara" "  Why, Jet?  I can't believe I trusted you.  You lied to me— you're sick and I trusted you!"
"1347" "Katara" "  What are you doing?"
"1348" "Katara" "  No!"
"1349" "Aang" "  Sokka's still out there— he's our only chance."
"1350" "Katara" "  Come on, Sokka.  I'm sorry I ever doubted you.  Please."
"1351" "Katara" "  No. . ."
"1352" "Aang" "  Sokka didn't make it in time."
"1353" "Katara" "  All those people. . .  Jet— you monster!"
"1354" "Sokka" "  It will be safe— without you."
"1355" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"1356" "Sokka" "  I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time."
"1357" "Sokka" "  At first they didn't believe me.  The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy.  But one man vouched for me— the old man you attacked.  He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time."
"1358" "Sokka" "  Who would be free— everyone would be dead."
"1359" "Sokka" "  No, Jet.  You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people."
"1360" "Katara" "  Goodbye Jet."
"1361" "Sokka" "  Yip yip."
"1362" "Aang" "  We thought you were going to the dam.  How come you went to the town instead?"
"1363" "Katara" "  Lemme guess— your instincts told you."
"1364" "Sokka" "  Hey— sometimes they're right."
"1365" "Aang" "  Um. . . Sokka?  You know we're going the wrong way, right?"
"1366" "Sokka" "  . . . And sometimes they're wrong.  "
"1367" "Katara" "  Um. . . aren't you forgetting the TARP?"
"1368" "Sokka" "  Right. . . got it."
"1369" "Katara" "   Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent.  You know, so we don't get RAINED on."
"1370" "Sokka" "  Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.  Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket."
"1371" "Katara" "  But what if it DOES rain?"
"1372" "Sokka" "   But what if it doesn't?  Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing."
"1373" "Katara" "   Ur. . . arg!  You're infuriating!"
"1374" "Sokka" "  Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry."
"1375" "Katara" "   Well if you don't like my firewood. . .   have it!"
"1376" "Sokka" "  Fine by me!  If you're not going to do your job  . . . urg!"
"1377" "Aang" "  Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the. . .   Hey, where's the campfire?  And what happened to the tent?"
"1378" "Sokka" "   Why don't you ask Miss Know It All?  Queen of the Twigs!"
"1379" "Katara" "   Oh yeah?   Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the  . . . Tents!"
"1380" "Aang" "   Okay, listen guys.  Harsh words won't solve problems, action will.  Why don't you just switch jobs?"
"1381" "Katara" "   Sounds good."
"1382" "Sokka" "   Whatever."
"1383" "Aang" "   You see that?  Settling feuds and making peace.  All in a days work for the Avatar."
"1384" "Aang" "  Come on Momo, that's fair.   Appa's got FIVE stomachs."
"1385" "Aang" "  Here it is, guys, the Great Divide."
"1386" "Katara" "  Wow!  I could just stare at it forever."
"1387" "Sokka" "   Okay.  I've seen enough."
"1388" "Katara" "  How can you not be fascinated, Sokka?  This is the largest canyon in the entire world."
"1389" "Sokka" "  Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away."
"1390" "Katara" "   Ooooo. . . canyon guide.  Sounds informative."
"1391" "Sokka" "  Calm down, we know you're next."
"1392" "Katara" "  You're a refugee."
"1393" "Katara" "  Is that your tribe?"
"1394" "Katara" "  Um. . .   one of them I think."
"1395" "Katara" "   Well Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test?"
"1396" "Aang" "   I. . .  don't know.  A fight over chores is one thing.  These people have been feuding for 100 years."
"1397" "Katara" "   Everyone, listen up!   This is the Avatar!  And if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy."
"1398" "Aang" "  Uh. . . you could share the earthbender and travel together?"
"1399" "Aang" "   Alright!  Here's the deal!   We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across.  Does that seem fair?"
"1400" "Aang" "  Sorry Appa.  You'll have to do this on your own."
"1401" "Sokka" "  This feuding tribe stuff is serious business.  Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?"
"1402" "Aang" "  To tell the truth, I'm not sure.   But when have I ever been?"
"1403" "Katara" "   He's the Avatar, Sokka.  Making peace between people is his job."
"1404" "Sokka" "   His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?"
"1405" "Aang" "  Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.   See ya on the other side, buddy.  Yip, yip!"
"1406" "Aang" "  Nice bending!"
"1407" "Aang" "  Why'd you do that?"
"1408" "Sokka" "  We gotta help him!"
"1409" "Sokka" "  Okay. . . now you gotta help me!"
"1410" "Aang" "  What was that?"
"1411" "Katara" "  Your arms. . . they're broken."
"1412" "Aang" "  . . . we're trapped in this canyon."
"1413" "Sokka" "   I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like. . .  canyon crawlers. . ."
"1414" "Aang" "  Look.  Sticking together is the only way to. . ."
"1415" "Aang" "   Any ideas?"
"1416" "Aang" "  ENOUGH!   I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not going to happen."
"1417" "Aang" "  We should split up.  Gan Jins on this side. . . and Zhangs on that side.  We'll travel in two separate lines."
"1418" "Aang" "  Sokka, you go with the Zhangs.  And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.  See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much."
"1419" "Sokka" "  So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?"
"1420" "Sokka" "   Exactly!"
"1421" "Sokka" "  Finally, someone gets it."
"1422" "Katara" "  You really think it'll rain?"
"1423" "Katara" "  So it was you guys who had food!"
"1424" "Katara" "   Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.   So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?"
"1425" "Sokka" "  Would I! ?"
"1426" "Sokka" "   Mm hmm!"
"1427" "Sokka" "   Mmmm!"
"1428" "Sokka" "  That's just terrible.   You gonna finish that?"
"1429" "Aang" "  Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.   It's okay, Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!"
"1430" "Aang" "  Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts."
"1431" "Aang" "  I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.  Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here."
"1432" "Aang" "  Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?"
"1433" "Katara" "   I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins.  They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb."
"1434" "Aang" "  What are you talking about?"
"1435" "Sokka" "  Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about?  We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin."
"1436" "Katara" "   Not punished enough if you ask me!"
"1437" "Aang" "  Okay!  Okay!  I get it!  Now I need your help.  Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall."
"1438" "Aang" "  Please everyone!  As soon as we get out of here we can eat, and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff."
"1439" "Aang" "  Guys!  FOCUS!  How many times do I have to say it?  Harsh words won't solve problems, ACTION will!"
"1440" "Aang" "   You know, I take it back!  Harsh words aren't so bad!"
"1441" "Aang" "  Is that. . .  food?   Everyone smuggled food down here! ?   UNBELIEVABLE!  You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day! ?  You are all. . . AWFUL!"
"1442" "Aang" "  So hungry. . .   is that. . . egg custard in that tart?"
"1443" "Katara" "  Oh no!  That's a lot of canyon crawlers!"
"1444" "Sokka" "   We barely survived one!"
"1445" "Katara" "  Sokka, wait!  I don't care about this stupid feud!  I just want us to get out of here alive."
"1446" "Sokka" "   Me too.  I only took their side because they fed me."
"1447" "Aang" "   Everybody!  Watch me!   Do what I do!"
"1448" "Aang" "   Now, follow me!  We're riding out of this hole!"
"1449" "Aang" "  Everyone!  Get off!"
"1450" "Aang" "  Wait a second!  Jin Wei?  Wei Jin?  I know those guys!"
"1451" "Aang" "  No!   I mean I really knew them.  I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old.  I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. . ."
"1452" "Aang" "  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.  First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers , twins in fact  and they were eight  and most importantly, they were just playing a game!  .  The sacred orb from the legend  . . . that was the ball.  And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts .  Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.  Win Jei didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal.  But he stepped out of bounds , so the official put him in the penalty box, not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes."
"1453" "Aang" "  There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison.  Just a game."
"1454" "Aang" "  Nope, just a regular ball."
"1455" "Aang" "  That's what the game was called, Redemption.  As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other everyone would yell, redemption!   Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true, but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field."
"1456" "Aang" "  Good to see ya, boy!  Did you miss me?"
"1457" "Aang" "   Well, you know, I try."
"1458" "Sokka" "  That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin."
"1459" "Aang" "   You could call it luck.   Or, you could call it. . .  lying!"
"1460" "Sokka" "  What! ?"
"1461" "Aang" "   I made the whole thing up."
"1462" "Katara" "   You did not!   That is so wrong."
"1463" "Aang" "   Now where's that custard tart?   I'm starving!"
"1464" "Katara" "  We need you, Aang."
"1465" "Aang" "  I need you too."
"1466" "Aang" "  Be careful guys!  Guys?"
"1467" "Aang" "  Gyatso?"
"1468" "Aang" "  I didn't mean to."
"1469" "Sokka" "  Huh?  Uh. . .  what's going on?  Did we get captured again?"
"1470" "Aang" "  It's nothing, I just had a bad dream.  Go back to sleep."
"1471" "Sokka" "  Don't have to tell me twice."
"1472" "Katara" "  Are you all right, Aang?"
"1473" "Aang" "  I'm okay."
"1474" "Katara" "  You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?"
"1475" "Aang" "  I think I just need some rest."
"1476" "Sokka" "  You guys want to hear about my dream?   That's ok, I didn't wanna talk about it anyway."
"1477" "Aang" "  Look at those clear skies, buddy!  Should be some smooth flying."
"1478" "Katara" "  Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food."
"1479" "Sokka" "  Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market."
"1480" "Katara" "  What happened in your dream?"
"1481" "Sokka" "  Food eats people!"
"1482" "Sokka" "  Also, Momo could talk.   You said some very unkind things."
"1483" "Iroh" "  There is a storm coming.  A big one."
"1484" "Zuko" "  You're out of your mind, Uncle.  The weather's perfect.  There is not a cloud in sight."
"1485" "Iroh" "  The storm is approaching from the north.  I suggest we alter our course and head southwest."
"1486" "Zuko" "  We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same."
"1487" "Iroh" "  Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew."
"1488" "Zuko" "  The safety of the crew doesn't matter!"
"1489" "Zuko" "  Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety."
"1490" "Iroh" "  He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up."
"1491" "Katara" "  I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing."
"1492" "Aang" "  I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe."
"1493" "Katara" "  I just realized we're out of money anyway."
"1494" "Sokka" "  Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do?"
"1495" "Katara" "  You could get a job, smart guy."
"1496" "Aang" "  Maybe we should find some shelter?"
"1497" "Sokka" "  Are you kidding?  Shelter from what?"
"1498" "Sokka" "  I'll go!"
"1499" "Sokka" "  What?  You said ‘get a job' and he's paying double."
"1500" "Iroh" "  Lucky guess."
"1501" "Zuko" "  Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect,  or I will teach it to you."
"1502" "Iroh" "  Easy now."
"1503" "Iroh" "  Enough!  We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long.  I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better."
"1504" "Zuko" "  I don't need your help keeping order on my ship."
"1505" "Aang" "  Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea.  Look at the sky."
"1506" "Sokka" "  I said I was gonna do this job.  I can't back out just because of some bad weather."
"1507" "Katara" "  That's right."
"1508" "Katara" "  Don't yell at him!  Aang would never turn his back on anyone!"
"1509" "Katara" "  Aang is the bravest person I know!  He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.  It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang?  Aang?  What's wrong?"
"1510" "Katara" "  You're a horrible old man!"
"1511" "Katara" "  Appa, yip!  Yip!"
"1512" "Sokka" "  Hey, they left without saying goodbye!"
"1513" "Sokka" "  I know!  This one time I was. . ."
"1514" "Aang" "  I'm sorry for running away."
"1515" "Katara" "  It's ok.  That fisherman was way out of line."
"1516" "Aang" "  Actually, he wasn't."
"1517" "Katara" "  What do you mean?"
"1518" "Aang" "  I don't wanna talk about it."
"1519" "Katara" "  It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?"
"1520" "Katara" "  Talk to me."
"1521" "Aang" "  Well, it's kind of a long story."
"1522" "Katara" "  I'm gonna try to get a little fire going."
"1523" "Aang" "  I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar."
"1524" "Aang" "  I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall.  I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter. . ."
"1525" "Aang" "  First, you form a ball.  Then you gotta get on quick."
"1526" "Aang" "  Quick, get on!"
"1527" "Aang" "  You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top."
"1528" "Aang" "  I made it up."
"1529" "Aang" "  How do you know it's me?"
"1530" "Aang" "  Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!"
"1531" "Aang" "  I just chose them because they seemed fun."
"1532" "Iroh" "  Do you really want to know?"
"1533" "Iroh" "  It's ok.  May I join you?"
"1534" "Iroh" "  Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man.  He has been through much. . ."
"1535" "Zuko" "  Let me in!"
"1536" "Iroh" "  Prince Zuko, what's wrong?"
"1537" "Zuko" "  I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!"
"1538" "Iroh" "  You're not missing anything, trust me.  These meetings are dreadfully boring."
"1539" "Zuko" "  If I'm gonna rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?"
"1540" "Iroh" "  Very well.  But you must promise not to speak.  These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know."
"1541" "Zuko" "  Thank you uncle!"
"1542" "Zuko" "  You can't sacrifice an entire division like that!  Those soldiers love and defend our nation!  How can you betray them?"
"1543" "Iroh" "  Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out, and there were. . .  dire consequences."
"1544" "Katara" "  So you were upset that you were the Avatar?  Why wouldn't you be excited about it?"
"1545" "Aang" "  Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.  All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing. . ."
"1546" "Aang" "  Hey, not bad!  You guys have been practicing!"
"1547" "Aang" "  Great!"
"1548" "Aang" "  What's going on?"
"1549" "Aang" "  But I'm still the same –  nothing's changed.  So, what, I can't play?"
"1550" "Aang" "  Oh, ok."
"1551" "Aang" "  What do you mean?"
"1552" "Aang" "  Hey!"
"1553" "Iroh" "  After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.  He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this. . ."
"1554" "Iroh" "  That's right.  Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid.  But Zuko misunderstood.  When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the General.  Zuko had spoken out against a general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.  Zuko would have to duel his own father."
"1555" "Aang" "  Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened."
"1556" "Aang" "  How could they do that to me!  They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!"
"1557" "Katara" "  Whoa!  Hot cinders!"
"1558" "Aang" "  I'm sorry I got so mad."
"1559" "Katara" "  You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that."
"1560" "Aang" "  Well, that's not exactly what happened. . ."
"1561" "Aang" "  I was afraid and confused.  I didn't know what to do."
"1562" "Aang" "  I never saw Gyatso again."
"1563" "Aang" "  Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg."
"1564" "Katara" "  You ran away."
"1565" "Aang" "  And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.  My people needed me and I wasn't there to help."
"1566" "Katara" "  You don't know what would've –"
"1567" "Aang" "  The world needed me and I wasn't there to help."
"1568" "Katara" "  Aang. . ."
"1569" "Aang" "  The fisherman was right!  I did turn my back on the world."
"1570" "Katara" "  You're being too hard on yourself.  Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be.  If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders."
"1571" "Aang" "  You don't know that."
"1572" "Katara" "  I know it's meant to be this way.  The world needs you now.  You give people hope."
"1573" "Iroh" "  When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy. . ."
"1574" "Zuko" "  Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart!  I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!"
"1575" "Zuko" "  I meant you no disrespect.  I am your loyal son."
"1576" "Zuko" "  I won't fight you."
"1577" "Iroh" "  It was no accident.  After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness.  As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.  Only then could he return with his honor."
"1578" "Iroh" "  Things will never return to normal.  But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope."
"1579" "Katara" "  It's ok, you're safe."
"1580" "Katara" "  What do you mean?  Where's Sokka?"
"1581" "Aang" "  I'm going to find them."
"1582" "Katara" "  I'm going with you."
"1583" "Aang" "  We'll be back soon, I promise."
"1584" "Zuko" "  Where were we hit?"
"1585" "Iroh" "  Look!"
"1586" "Zuko" "  The helmsman!"
"1587" "Katara" "  Where are they?"
"1588" "Aang" "  Come on, Appa!"
"1589" "Aang" "  The boat!  It's there!"
"1590" "Zuko" "  The Avatar!"
"1591" "Zuko" "  Let him go.  We need to get this ship to safety."
"1592" "Iroh" "  Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm."
"1593" "Sokka" "  I'm too young to die!"
"1594" "Aang" "  Hang on to the rope!"
"1595" "Zuko" "  Uncle, I am sorry."
"1596" "Iroh" "  Your apology is accepted."
"1597" "Aang" "  He doesn't have to apologize."
"1598" "Aang" "  Actually, I don't eat meat."
"1599" "Sokka" "  Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?"
"1600" "Aang" "  Katara, I think you were right before.  I'm done dwelling on the past."
"1601" "Katara" "  Really?"
"1602" "Aang" "  I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away.  I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it."
"1603" "Katara" "  I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore."
"1604" "Sokka" "  Do you hear that?  It's stopped raining."
"1605" "Katara" "  This should bring your fever down."
"1606" "Sokka" "  You know what I love about Appa the most?  His sense of humor."
"1607" "Katara" "  That's nice.  I'll tell him."
"1608" "Sokka" "  Haha!  Classic Appa."
"1609" "Aang" "  How's Sokka doing?"
"1610" "Katara" "  Not so good.  Being out in that storm really did a number on him."
"1611" "Aang" "  I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map."
"1612" "Aang" "  There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain.  We could probably find a cure for Sokka there."
"1613" "Katara" "  Aang, he's in no condition to travel.  Sokka just needs more rest.  I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow."
"1614" "Aang" "  Not you too!"
"1615" "Katara" "  Relax, it was just a little cough.  I'm fine –"
"1616" "Aang" "  That's how Sokka started yesterday.  Now look at him –  he thinks he's an earthbender!"
"1617" "Sokka" "  Take that, you rock!"
"1618" "Aang" "  A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.   I'm going to find some medicine."
"1619" "Aang" "  Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.   Keep an eye on'em guys."
"1620" "Sokka" "  Haha!  You guys are killin' me!"
"1621" "Zuko" "  What do they want?"
"1622" "Iroh" "  Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!"
"1623" "Iroh" "  Zhao has been promoted?  Well, good for him!"
"1624" "Zuko" "  I've got nothing to report to Zhao.  Now get off my ship and let us pass."
"1625" "Zuko" "  Off my ship!"
"1626" "Iroh" "  Excellent!  ake the pot.  But, you're all improving.  I'm certain you will win if we play again. Cut to Zuko looking out over the waves as Iroh and the men begin another game in the background behind him.  Cut to a view of a mountain path.  The screen pans right to reveal a Fire Nation lookout post, the switch to a view inside the post.  One of the lookouts is looking out with a telescope, another is reading Aang's wanted poster."
"1627" "Sokka" "  Katara. . .  please. . .  water. . ."
"1628" "Katara" "  Listen carefully, Momo.  I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water."
"1629" "Aang" "  Hello!  I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends.  They have fevers and they've been coughing and –"
"1630" "Aang" "  That's nice."
"1631" "Aang" "  That's nice.  Are you almost done?"
"1632" "Iroh" "  Is everything okay?  It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order."
"1633" "Zuko" "  I don't care what they do."
"1634" "Iroh" "  Don't give up hope yet.  You can still find the Avatar before Zhao."
"1635" "Zuko" "  How, Uncle?  With Zhao's resources it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar.   My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all."
"1636" "Aang" "  Finally!"
"1637" "Aang" "  Thanks for all your help!"
"1638" "Aang" "  Taking the cure to my friends!"
"1639" "Aang" "  What about my friends?"
"1640" "Aang" "  What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?"
"1641" "Aang" "  Suck on them! ?"
"1642" "Aang" "  You're insane aren't you?"
"1643" "Aang" "  Uhh, I think you dropped this."
"1644" "Aang" "  A frog!"
"1645" "Aang" "  I've never hidden from you.  Untie me and I'll fight you right now!"
"1646" "Sokka" "  Water. . ."
"1647" "Katara" "  Momo should be back any minute."
"1648" "Katara" "  Ugh!  No, Momo, water.  Wa- ter!   Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?"
"1649" "Aang" "  What?  No!  Don't leave frogs!  My friends are sick and they need you!  Please go back to being frozen!"
"1650" "Aang" "  My frogs!  Come back!  And stop thawing out!   Wait!  My friends need to suck on those frogs!"
"1651" "Katara" "  How many times do I have to tell you, Momo, we need water.  Wa- ter.  Oh forget it.  Aang, please, hurry."
"1652" "Sokka" "  Who's this Aang kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?"
"1653" "Aang" "  Stay close to me!"
"1654" "Aang" "  Here, take this.  Jump on my back!"
"1655" "Aang" "  Gimme the next one!"
"1656" "Aang" "  You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is?  I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.  Before the war started , I used to always my friend Kuzon.  The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.  He was one of the best friends I ever had  –  and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.   If we knew each other back then , do you think we could have been friends too?"
"1657" "Iroh" "  Where have you been, Prince Zuko?  You missed music night!  Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song."
"1658" "Zuko" "  I'm going to bed.  No disturbances."
"1659" "Aang" "  Suck on these.  They'll make you feel better."
"1660" "Sokka" "  Aang, how was your trip?  Did you make any new friends?"
"1661" "Aang" "  No, I don't think I did."
"1662" "Sokka" "  Mmmm!  This is tasty!  Mmm! "
"1663" "Katara" "  Look!"
"1664" "Sokka" "  He is taunting us.   You are so gonna be dinner!   Hey!  Where's the fishing line?"
"1665" "Aang" "  Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka."
"1666" "Sokka" "  Aahh, it's all tangled!"
"1667" "Aang" "  Not tangled –  woven.   I made you a necklace, Katara.   I thought since you lost your other one. . ."
"1668" "Katara" "  Thanks, Aang.  I love it."
"1669" "Sokka" "  Great, Aang.  Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making business."
"1670" "Aang" "  I don't see why I can't do both."
"1671" "Sokka" "  Stop taunting me!"
"1672" "Katara" "  So, how do I look?"
"1673" "Aang" "  You mean all of you or just your neck?  I mean, uh, both look great."
"1674" "Sokka" "  Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love."
"1675" "Aang" "  I. . . well. . ."
"1676" "Katara" "  Stop teasing him, Sokka.   Aang's just a good friend.   A sweet little guy –  just like Momo."
"1677" "Aang" "  Thanks."
"1678" "Aang" "  Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!"
"1679" "Aang" "  Make noise, it'll run off!"
"1680" "Sokka" "  No, play dead, he'll lose interest!"
"1681" "Katara" "  Run down hill, then climb a tree!"
"1682" "Sokka" "  No, punch him in the bill!"
"1683" "Aang" "  And then run in zigzags!"
"1684" "Aang" "  Whoa there!"
"1685" "Sokka" "  Mmm!  Lunch!   Lucky for you we came along."
"1686" "Aang" "  Aunt who?"
"1687" "Katara" "  Wow, it must be.  That explains why you were so calm."
"1688" "Sokka" "  But the fortuneteller was wrong!  You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!"
"1689" "Katara" "  Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes.  It could be fun."
"1690" "Sokka" "  Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense."
"1691" "Aang" "  What do ya know, an umbrella!"
"1692" "Katara" "  That proves it."
"1693" "Sokka" "  No it doesn't –  you can't really tell the future."
"1694" "Katara" "  I guess you're not really getting wet then."
"1695" "Sokka" "  Of course she predicted it was gonna rain.  The sky's been gray all day."
"1696" "Katara" "  Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella."
"1697" "Sokka" "  Look, I'm going to predict the future now  –  “It's going to keep drizzling. ”  See!"
"1698" "Aang" "  Not everyone has the gift, Sokka."
"1699" "Sokka" "  Yahhh!"
"1700" "Katara" "  Really?"
"1701" "Aang" "  Hello."
"1702" "Sokka" "  I'll try a curd puff."
"1703" "Aang" "  Aang."
"1704" "Aang" "  I. . .  guess. . ."
"1705" "Sokka" "  Oh, don't be modest.  They're huge!"
"1706" "Aang" "  Likewise."
"1707" "Sokka" "  I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense."
"1708" "Katara" "  Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.  There are things in this world that just can't be explained.  Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?"
"1709" "Sokka" "  It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs."
"1710" "Aang" "  Good luck with that!"
"1711" "Katara" "  I guess that's me."
"1712" "Sokka" "  Not bad.  Not bad.  Mmmm!"
"1713" "Aang" "  I'm good on puffs.  So. . . what do you think they're talking about back there?"
"1714" "Sokka" "  Boring stuff, I'm sure.  Love.  Who she's going to marry.  How many babies she's gonna have."
"1715" "Aang" "  Yeh. . .  dumb stuff like that. . .   well, I've gotta find a bathroom!"
"1716" "Katara" "  Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion.  I could get you some if you want.   So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?"
"1717" "Katara" "  Tell me more!"
"1718" "Sokka" "  Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break."
"1719" "Aang" "  Yeh, when I was in there. . ."
"1720" "Sokka" "  I don't even wanna know!"
"1721" "Sokka" "  Okay, let's get this over with."
"1722" "Sokka" "  But, you didn't read my palms or anything!"
"1723" "Aang" "  Wow, that's a big crack."
"1724" "Aang" "  Yeh, yeh, I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl?"
"1725" "Aang" "  Yes!"
"1726" "Sokka" "  Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax."
"1727" "Katara" "  You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life."
"1728" "Sokka" "  That woman is crazy!  My life will be calm, and happy and joyful!"
"1729" "Sokka" "  Ow!   That doesn't prove anything!"
"1730" "Katara" "  Well, I liked my predictions.  Certain things are going to turn out very well."
"1731" "Aang" "  They sure are."
"1732" "Katara" "  Why, what did she tell you?"
"1733" "Aang" "  Some stuff.  You'll find out."
"1734" "Katara" "  What's with the sky?"
"1735" "Aang" "  That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny."
"1736" "Sokka" "  Do you even hear yourself?"
"1737" "Sokka" "  I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition."
"1738" "Katara" "  Shhhh! !  She's coming!"
"1739" "Aang" "  Sure, I guess.   Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?"
"1740" "Katara" "  Shh! !"
"1741" "Aang" "  Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.  I like you, but more than normal."
"1742" "Aang" "  Never mind."
"1743" "Katara" "  Hi, Aunt Wu.  Sorry to bother you."
"1744" "Katara" "  About this man I'm supposed to marry . . . is he gonna be handsome?   Oh, I hope he's tall!"
"1745" "Katara" "  Yes, please!"
"1746" "Sokka" "  I can't believe all these saps.   Someone really needs to scream some sense at them."
"1747" "Aang" "  They seem happy, Sokka."
"1748" "Sokka" "  Not for long.  I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.   Hey, you.  I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?"
"1749" "Sokka" "  Uh- huh.  And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?"
"1750" "Sokka" "  THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO COME TRUE!"
"1751" "Katara" "  Wow, thanks Aunt Wu.   Oh, wait, one more thing.  How warmly should I dress tomorrow?"
"1752" "Sokka" "  I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!"
"1753" "Aang" "  So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?"
"1754" "Sokka" "  Some stuff?  You've come to the right place.   What can I do you for?"
"1755" "Aang" "  Well, there's this girl. . ."
"1756" "Sokka" "  I think I know who you mean."
"1757" "Aang" "  You do?  And you're ok with it?"
"1758" "Sokka" "  Of course I am.  And, to tell you the truth, I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes you too."
"1759" "Aang" "  She does! ?"
"1760" "Sokka" "  Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya.  All ya have to do now is not mess it up."
"1761" "Aang" "  Well, how do I do that?"
"1762" "Sokka" ""
"1763" "Aang" "  You can be too nice?"
"1764" "Sokka" "  Yup.  If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other."
"1765" "Aang" "  Well. . . ok."
"1766" "Aang" "  See ya later."
"1767" "Sokka" "  Wow, that kid is good."
"1768" "Katara" "  Okay, okay, but, one more thing."
"1769" "Katara" "  Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?"
"1770" "Katara" "  Ohhh, I hate papaya."
"1771" "Aang" "  Oh, hey Katara.  I didn't see you there."
"1772" "Katara" "  Hey Aang."
"1773" "Aang" "  That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff."
"1774" "Katara" "  Ugh.  Papaya please."
"1775" "Aang" "  So. . . papaya."
"1776" "Katara" "  Uh- huh.  Would you like some?"
"1777" "Aang" "  You know me.   I don't really care what I eat."
"1778" "Katara" "  Ok then.  See you later."
"1779" "Aang" "  Maybe aloof isn't my style."
"1780" "Aang" "  Did you see that?"
"1781" "Aang" "  Excuse me.  Where can a guy find one of those things?"
"1782" "Sokka" "  I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower."
"1783" "Aang" "  Not just any flower –  a panda lilly.  I've seen it in action and boy does it work."
"1784" "Sokka" "  Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness."
"1785" "Aang" "  But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love."
"1786" "Sokka" "  What?  Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too."
"1787" "Aang" "  Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.  Why should she be wrong about love?   There, on the rim!"
"1788" "Aang" "  Oh no!  Aunt Wu was wrong."
"1789" "Aang" "  There's no time to walk.   Grab on."
"1790" "Sokka" "  Aaahhh!"
"1791" "Aang" "  Hi, Katara."
"1792" "Katara" "  Can you believe she won't let me in?  And after all the business I've given her?"
"1793" "Aang" "  But, she doesn't even charge."
"1794" "Katara" "  I know, but still."
"1795" "Sokka" "  Well, we have other things to worry about.  Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano."
"1796" "Katara" "  Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.  It's going to take an awful lot to change my min –"
"1797" "Katara" "  Oh, no!"
"1798" "Sokka" "  Everyone!  That volcano is gonna blow any second.  Aunt Wu was wrong!"
"1799" "Aang" "  Please listen to us!  You are all in danger!  And we have to get out of here.  You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction.  You have to take fate into your own hands."
"1800" "Sokka" "  Look!   Can your fortunetelling explain that?"
"1801" "Sokka" "  Yes!  Yes, it can!"
"1802" "Katara" "  They just won't listen to reason."
"1803" "Aang" "  But they will listen to Aunt Wu."
"1804" "Sokka" "  I know, that's the problem."
"1805" "Aang" "  Well, it's about to become the solution.  We're taking fate in our own ha Oh look!  nds.  First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book."
"1806" "Aang" "  Shh. . .  we don't want anyone to hear us."
"1807" "Aang" "  Oh!  I didn't see you there."
"1808" "Aang" "  Of course I like you."
"1809" "Aang" "  Oh.  I guess not."
"1810" "Aang" "  I know what you mean."
"1811" "Aang" "  Huh?"
"1812" "Aang" "  Don't worry.  You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you.  I know it."
"1813" "Aang" "  How did you know?"
"1814" "Aang" "  Oh, thanks.  I guess."
"1815" "Aang" "  Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want."
"1816" "Katara" "  I found it.  The symbol for volcanic doom."
"1817" "Sokka" "  Aunt Wu, look!  Something is happening in the clouds."
"1818" "Aang" "  We can still save the village if we act fast.  Sokka has a plan."
"1819" "Sokka" "  Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.  If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river."
"1820" "Aang" "  If any of you are earthebenders come with me."
"1821" "Sokka" "  Everybody else grab a shovel . . .  come on, we've gotta hurry!"
"1822" "Sokka" "  Dig faster!  Dig faster!"
"1823" "Aang" "  Everyone needs to evacuate!  We'll come for you when it's safe!"
"1824" "Katara" "  It's too much!  It's gonna overflow!"
"1825" "Sokka" "  Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender  that kid is."
"1826" "Katara" "  Wait, what did you just say?"
"1827" "Sokka" "  Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender."
"1828" "Katara" "  I suppose he is. . ."
"1829" "Aang" "  By the way, we kind of borrowed your book."
"1830" "Sokka" "  No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortunetelling."
"1831" "Sokka" "  I hate you."
"1832" "Katara" "  It's ok, Sokka.  Everything's gonna be all right."
"1833" "Aang" "  Can I ask you something?"
"1834" "Aang" "  You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?  You just told me what I wanted to hear."
"1835" "Katara" "  Goodbye everyone!  It was so nice to meet you!  Take care, Meng."
"1836" "Aang" "  Hey look!  A sword made out of a whale's tooth."
"1837" "Sokka" "  Lemme see that."
"1838" "Sokka" "  This is a water tribe weapon.   See if you can find anything else."
"1839" "Katara" "  Did someone lose something?"
"1840" "Aang" ""
"1841" "Sokka" "  It's burned."
"1842" "Sokka" "  There was a battle.  Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders."
"1843" "Sokka" "  The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill. . ."
"1844" "Aang" "  So then what happened?"
"1845" "Sokka" "  I don't know.  The trail ends here."
"1846" "Katara" "  Wait!  Look!"
"1847" "Sokka" "  It's one of our boats!"
"1848" "Katara" "  Is this. . .  Dad's boat?"
"1849" "Sokka" "  No, but it's from his fleet.  Dad was here."
"1850" "Iroh" "  Ahh!  See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being."
"1851" "Zuko" "  There are no stowaways on my ship."
"1852" "Zuko" "  He's paralyzed."
"1853" "Zuko" "  But how did you find him on my ship?"
"1854" "Iroh" "  Well, I'm impressed."
"1855" "Iroh" "  Very impressed."
"1856" "Sokka" "  I'm coming with you."
"1857" "Sokka" "  I'm strong!  I'm brave!  I can fight!  Please, Dad!"
"1858" "Sokka" "  I don't understand."
"1859" "Sokka" "  Who's there?"
"1860" "Sokka" "  Bato?"
"1861" "Aang" "  Who the what now?"
"1862" "Katara" "  Bato!"
"1863" "Aang" "  Hi, I'm Aang."
"1864" "Sokka" "  Where's Dad?"
"1865" "Katara" "  Is he here?"
"1866" "Aang" "  Thank you!  It's truly an honor to be here.  If there's anything –"
"1867" "Sokka" "  What smells so good, Bato?"
"1868" "Sokka" "  Perfume?  Maybe we could dump some on Appa?  Because he stinks so much!  Am I right?"
"1869" "Katara" "  Bato!  It looks like home!"
"1870" "Sokka" "  Everything's here, even the pelts!"
"1871" "Aang" "  Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins."
"1872" "Katara" "  No way!  Stewed sea prunes?"
"1873" "Sokka" "  Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things."
"1874" "Katara" "  Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?"
"1875" "Aang" "  Hey, I ride animals too!  One time there was this giant eel –"
"1876" "Sokka" "  So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco?"
"1877" "Katara" "  Everyone does."
"1878" "Aang" "  What's that story?"
"1879" "Sokka" "  It's a long one, Aang, some other time."
"1880" "Katara" "  You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures."
"1881" "Sokka" "  Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran- Gran you were a water spirit?"
"1882" "Zuko" "  Out of my way!  Step aside, filth!"
"1883" "Iroh" "  He means no offense!  I'm sure you bathe regularly."
"1884" "Zuko" "  I need to talk to you."
"1885" "Zuko" "  Your beast trashed my ship.  You have to pay me back."
"1886" "Zuko" "  Money isn't what I had in mind."
"1887" "Zuko" "  I need you to find someone."
"1888" "Zuko" "  It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with."
"1889" "Zuko" "  If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for."
"1890" "Iroh" "  Plus we'll pay your weight in gold."
"1891" "Iroh" "  You got it!"
"1892" "Katara" "  Really?"
"1893" "Sokka" "  When?"
"1894" "Sokka" "  It's been over two years since we've seen Dad!  That would be so incredible.  Katara?"
"1895" "Katara" "  I do really miss him.  It would be great to see Dad."
"1896" "Sokka" "  It would be great, but we can't.  We have to take Aang to the North Pole first."
"1897" "Katara" "  Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.  We don't have time for a long detour."
"1898" "Aang" "  I can't believe they would leave me."
"1899" "Aang" "  Uh, I know Bato."
"1900" "Aang" "  It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad!"
"1901" "Aang" "  Hey everyone!  Sorry I was gone so long."
"1902" "Katara" "  Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left."
"1903" "Aang" "  Yup, but now I'm back.  Sure. . . could go for some delicious sea prunes!"
"1904" "Zuko" "  We're looking for someone."
"1905" "Aang" "  I'm sorry!  I'll take care of this."
"1906" "Sokka" "  Is this the boat he took you ice- dodging in?"
"1907" "Katara" "  He never got to go.  Dad left before he was old enough."
"1908" "Aang" "  What's ice- dodging?"
"1909" "Zuko" "  Why are we stopping?"
"1910" "Zuko" "  We have no time for this!"
"1911" "Zuko" "  Hey, watch it!"
"1912" "Iroh" "  At my age there is really only one big surprise left, and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery."
"1913" "Sokka" "  How are we supposed to ice- dodge without ice?"
"1914" "Aang" "  I know that!  Why wouldn't I know that?  I'm the Avatar!  I know about trust."
"1915" "Sokka" "  Aang, ease up on the jib.  Katara, steady!  Aang, less sail!   Katara, give him room!"
"1916" "Sokka" "  Aang!  Helm to lee!  Helm to lee!"
"1917" "Aang" "  What does that even mean! ?"
"1918" "Sokka" "  Great job!"
"1919" "Katara" "  There's no way through!"
"1920" "Sokka" "  We can make it!"
"1921" "Sokka" "  Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail!   Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!   Now!"
"1922" "Aang" "  I can't."
"1923" "Katara" "  Of course you can!"
"1924" "Aang" "  No, you can't trust me."
"1925" "Katara" "  Aang, what are you talking about."
"1926" "Aang" "  A messenger gave this to me for Bato.   You have to understand, I was afraid you'd –"
"1927" "Sokka" "  This is the map to our father!  You had it the whole time! ?  How could you?   Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own!  I'm going to find Dad."
"1928" "Sokka" "  Katara, are you with me?"
"1929" "Katara" "  I'm with you, Sokka."
"1930" "Aang" "  Okay.  You too."
"1931" "Aang" "  Guess I should be moving on."
"1932" "Aang" "  I'm an idiot, Momo."
"1933" "Katara" "  That wolf sounds so sad."
"1934" "Sokka" "  It's probably wounded."
"1935" "Katara" "  Sokka?"
"1936" "Sokka" "  We need to go back.  I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most."
"1937" "Katara" "  You're right."
"1938" "Sokka" "  Thanks, Bato."
"1939" "Aang" "  Looks like we're going alone, guys."
"1940" "Aang" "  Okay, I get it.  Everybody wants me gone."
"1941" "Aang" "  Who?"
"1942" "Aang" "  Zuko!"
"1943" "Aang" "  A necklace?   Huh!  Katara!"
"1944" "Zuko" "  Where is he?  Where's the Avatar?"
"1945" "Sokka" "  We split up!  He's long gone."
"1946" "Zuko" "  How stupid do you think I am?"
"1947" "Sokka" "  Pretty stupid.   Run!"
"1948" "Zuko" "  What are we supposed to do now?"
"1949" "Zuko" "  What's it doing?  It's just going around in a circle!"
"1950" "Katara" "  Aang!"
"1951" "Sokka" "  I'm starting to get some feeling back!   Ow!"
"1952" "Aang" "  You've got something I want!"
"1953" "Sokka" "  That thing sees with its nose.  Let's give him something to look at."
"1954" "Iroh" "  June!  Noooo!"
"1955" "Zuko" "  Uncle?  I didn't see you get hit with the tongue."
"1956" "Iroh" "  Shh!"
"1957" "Aang" "  So, where do we go?"
"1958" "Katara" "  We're getting you to the North Pole."
"1959" "Sokka" "  Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is."
"1960" "Aang" "  Don't you want to see your father?"
"1961" "Sokka" "  Of course we do, Aang.  But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more."
"1962" "Katara" "  And we need you."
"1963" "Aang" "  I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara.  Something to remind you –"
"1964" "Katara" "  I'll be okay."
"1965" "Aang" "  Still, just a little trinket.  Maybe something like. . . this!"
"1966" "Katara" "  Aang, how did you get that?"
"1967" "Aang" "  Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you."
"1968" "Katara" "  Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko.  Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?"
"1969" "Aang" "  Sure!"
"1970" "Katara" "  This should give us a good idea of what's around here."
"1971" "Sokka" "  See if you can find a menu, I'm starving."
"1972" "Aang" "  I bet we'll find something to eat here!  .  The Fire Days Festival.   Fire Nation cultural exhibits. . . jugglers, benders, magicians.  This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!"
"1973" "Sokka" "  You might wanna rethink that.  Look at this."
"1974" "Aang" "  Hey, a poster of me!"
"1975" "Sokka" "  A wanted poster.  This is bad."
"1976" "Katara" "  I think we better keep moving."
"1977" "Aang" "  I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close."
"1978" "Katara" "  I guess we could check it out."
"1979" "Sokka" "  What! ?  You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?"
"1980" "Katara" "  We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave."
"1981" "Sokka" "  Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble."
"1982" "Aang" "  You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival."
"1983" "Aang" "  Ready disguises!"
"1984" "Sokka" "  It's like you're a whole different person."
"1985" "Aang" "  Let's go."
"1986" "Katara" "  I think we need some new disguises."
"1987" "Sokka" "  Where are we gonna get masks like that?"
"1988" "Sokka" "  That was surprisingly easy."
"1989" "Aang" "  Hey, there's some food."
"1990" "Sokka" "  Finally!"
"1991" "Sokka" "  I'll take'em!"
"1992" "Sokka" "  Aaahhh!  Hot!  Hot!"
"1993" "Katara" "  Flaming fire flakes hot?  What do you know."
"1994" "Aang" "  Hey, look at this."
"1995" "Katara" "  Aang, hold on!  Where are we going?"
"1996" "Aang" "  I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good."
"1997" "Sokka" "  Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution."
"1998" "Aang" "  I gotta learn that trick!"
"1999" "Aang" "  Oh!  Oh!  Me!  Me!"
"2000" "Sokka" "  What do you think you're doing?"
"2001" "Aang" "  I want to get a closer look."
"2002" "Katara" "  It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves."
"2003" "Katara" ""
"2004" "Aang" "  Awww!  That could'a been me."
"2005" "Aang" "  We gotta help her!"
"2006" "Sokka" "  No, we don't want to make a scene!"
"2007" "Sokka" "  I think it's time to go."
"2008" "Aang" "  I'm calling Appa!"
"2009" "Sokka" "  I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!"
"2010" "Aang" "  Appa!  Down here!"
"2011" "Aang" "  Nice touch setting off the fireworks."
"2012" "Sokka" "  You seem to really know your explosives."
"2013" "Sokka" "  You're a Fire Nation soldier!"
"2014" "Sokka" "  He was very highly ranked, we get it."
"2015" "Aang" "  You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?   We've gotta go see him!  He can train me!"
"2016" "Sokka" "  We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!"
"2017" "Sokka" "  Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning."
"2018" "Aang" "  Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me."
"2019" "Katara" "  It can't hurt just to talk to him."
"2020" "Sokka" "  That's what you said about going to the festival!  Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me! ?"
"2021" "Sokka" "  Hold on, you know these guys! ?"
"2022" "Aang" "  Is that where Jeong Jeong is?  I need to talk to him right away."
"2023" "Aang" "  What happened?  Can I see Jeong Jeong now?"
"2024" "Sokka" "  Finally!  Let's hit the road."
"2025" "Aang" "  Why won't he see me?"
"2026" "Aang" "  Wait, how does he know that?"
"2027" "Aang" "  I'm going in anyway!"
"2028" "Aang" "  Master, I need to learn firebending."
"2029" "Aang" "  I'm the Avatar.  It's my destiny to. . ."
"2030" "Aang" "  Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines."
"2031" "Aang" "  Please, I have to learn.  This could be my only chance."
"2032" "Aang" "  Really?  That's great!"
"2033" "Aang" "  Wait!  What do I do now?"
"2034" "Sokka" "  Hey!"
"2035" "Aang" "  But what am I concentrating on?"
"2036" "Aang" "  So when do I get to make some fire?"
"2037" "Aang" "  Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?"
"2038" "Aang" "  What?"
"2039" "Aang" "  You brought me up here to breathe?"
"2040" "Aang" "  You're not even look. . ."
"2041" "Aang" "  I've been breathing for hours."
"2042" "Aang" "  I want you to stop wasting my time!  I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun.   I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!"
"2043" "Aang" "  I thought about what you said.  I promise I'll be more patient."
"2044" "Aang" "  Oh yeh!"
"2045" "Aang" "  I mean, let us begin."
"2046" "Aang" "  What's going on?"
"2047" "Aang" "  This is the worst firebending instruction ever.  All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe."
"2048" "Katara" "  I'm sure there's a good reason."
"2049" "Aang" "  But I'm ready to do so much more."
"2050" "Aang" "  I did it!  I made fire!"
"2051" "Katara" "  Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow."
"2052" "Katara" "  Careful!"
"2053" "Aang" "  Now that's firebending!"
"2054" "Katara" "  Aang, you'll hurt yourself!"
"2055" "Aang" "  Wonder how that juggler did it?"
"2056" "Aang" "  Katara!   I'm so sorry!"
"2057" "Sokka" "  Katara, what's wrong! ?   What did you do?"
"2058" "Aang" "  Iiiit was an accident!  I was. . .  Katara, I'm so -"
"2059" "Sokka" "  I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!  Look what you did!  You burned my sister!"
"2060" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, I didn't. . .   I'm sorry!"
"2061" "Katara" "  But you're a great master.  You have powers I'll never know."
"2062" "Sokka" "  Katara!  Are you all right?"
"2063" "Katara" "  I'm fine, we've got to get out of here.  Where's Aang?"
"2064" "Aang" "  Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.  I wouldn't listen.  I'm never going to firebend again."
"2065" "Katara" "  You'll have to eventually."
"2066" "Aang" "  No, never again."
"2067" "Katara" "  It's okay, Aang.  I'm healed."
"2068" "Aang" "  What?  How?"
"2069" "Katara" "  I'll explain later.  But right now, we have to get out here.  Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!"
"2070" "Aang" "  Where?"
"2071" "Katara" "  By the river.  They captured Jeong Jeong."
"2072" "Aang" "  I have to help him!"
"2073" "Aang" "  Jeong Jeong!"
"2074" "Aang" "  YOU were Jeong Jeong's student?"
"2075" "Aang" "  Whoa!  Wild shot!"
"2076" "Aang" "  No self control. . ."
"2077" "Aang" "  Oh, were we fighting?  I thought you were just getting warmed up."
"2078" "Aang" "  Is that all you got?  Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!"
"2079" "Aang" "  Ahoy!   I'm Admiral Zhao!"
"2080" "Aang" "  I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko."
"2081" "Aang" "  Sloppy.  Very sloppy."
"2082" "Aang" "  You've lost this battle."
"2083" "Aang" "  No, but you have."
"2084" "Aang" "  Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint."
"2085" "Aang" "  Have a nice walk home!"
"2086" "Sokka" "  He disappeared.  They all did."
"2087" "Katara" "  Aang, you're burned."
"2088" "Katara" "  Let me help you."
"2089" "Aang" "  Wow!  That's good water."
"2090" "Sokka" "  When did you learn how to do that?"
"2091" "Katara" "  I guess I always knew."
"2092" "Sokka" "  Oh. . .  well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.  Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!"
"2093" "Aang" "  Two?"
"2094" "Katara" "  He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook."
"2095" "Sokka" "  Oh, and the time that big snake bit me!  Thanks for healing that up.  That was great.  Really helpful."
"2096" "Aang" "  Aren't airbender stories the best?"
"2097" "Katara" "  Was it realistic?  Was that how it was back then?"
"2098" "Aang" "  I laugh at gravity all the time.  Haha!  Gravity."
"2099" "Sokka" "  Sorry!"
"2100" "Aang" "  Hey thanks for the story!"
"2101" "Aang" "  It means a lot to hear airbender stories.  It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa met them."
"2102" "Aang" "  Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple!  This is where they had the championships for sky bison polo."
"2103" "Katara" "  Do you think we'll really find airbenders?"
"2104" "Sokka" "  You want me to be like you, or totally honest?"
"2105" "Katara" "  Are you saying I'm a liar?"
"2106" "Sokka" "  I'm saying you're an optimist.  Same thing basically."
"2107" "Aang" "  Hey guys, look at this!"
"2108" "Katara" "  Huh!  They really are airbenders!"
"2109" "Aang" "  No, they're not."
"2110" "Sokka" "  What do you mean they're not?  Those guys are flying!"
"2111" "Aang" "  Gliding maybe, but not flying.  You can tell by the way they move.  They're not airbending.  Those people have no spirit."
"2112" "Katara" "  I don't know, Aang.  That kid seems pretty spirited!"
"2113" "Sokka" "  We better find some solid ground before it finds us!"
"2114" "Aang" "  Yeh, I know.  But I can do more than fancy gliding!"
"2115" "Aang" "  It's great."
"2116" "Aang" "  Thanks."
"2117" "Sokka" "  Wow!  This glider chair is incredible!"
"2118" "Aang" "  This place is unbelievable."
"2119" "Aang" "  No, just unbelievable."
"2120" "Katara" "  Aang used to come here a long time ago.  I think he's a little shocked it's so. . .  different."
"2121" "Sokka" "  So better!"
"2122" "Aang" "  This is supposed to be the history of my people."
"2123" "Aang" "  Ugh!"
"2124" "Katara" "  I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same."
"2125" "Aang" "  It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined."
"2126" "Aang" "  Do you know what you did?  You just destroyed something sacred!  For a stupid bathhouse!"
"2127" "Aang" "  This whole place stinks!"
"2128" "Aang" "  This is a sacred temple!  You can't treat it this way.  I've seen it when the monks were here.  I know what it's supposed to be like."
"2129" "Aang" "  What are you doing?  Who said you could be here?"
"2130" "Aang" "  Our gliders."
"2131" "Aang" "  Nature knows where to stop."
"2132" "Sokka" "  Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing?  The notches all look the same."
"2133" "Sokka" "  You put spark powder in the candle!"
"2134" "Sokka" "  Aaahhh!"
"2135" "Aang" "  I just can't get over it.  There's not a single thing that's the same."
"2136" "Katara" "  You're right.  They're kind of keepers of the temples origins."
"2137" "Katara" "  Hey!  It's just like the one in the other Air Temple."
"2138" "Katara" "  Aang?"
"2139" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was.  I want it to stay that way."
"2140" "Aang" "  Thanks."
"2141" "Sokka" "  These lanterns are terrible!  I can't see."
"2142" "Sokka" "  Why would you want to use fireflies for light?"
"2143" "Sokka" "  Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room."
"2144" "Sokka" "  So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?"
"2145" "Katara" "  I've changed my mind.  I think I was born without that something."
"2146" "Aang" "  Spirit."
"2147" "Aang" "  That's the something you're talking about."
"2148" "Katara" "  No!"
"2149" "Katara" "  I can't believe I'm flying!"
"2150" "Aang" "  Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!"
"2151" "Katara" "  Teo was right about the air!  All I had to do was trust it.  Let it carry me."
"2152" "Aang" "  Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one."
"2153" "Aang" "  I've been thinking.  If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you."
"2154" "Katara" "  Wait!  How do I land this thing?  What if I land  –  eh!  Blech!  Yech!  Bug!  Bug!  That was a bug!"
"2155" "Sokka" "  Ugh!  Week old egg smell!"
"2156" "Sokka" "  How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!"
"2157" "Sokka" "  Yeh!"
"2158" "Sokka" "  If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up. . ."
"2159" "Sokka" "  Then, if there's a leak. . ."
"2160" "Sokka" "  And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!"
"2161" "Aang" "  This is a nightmare."
"2162" "Aang" "  You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!"
"2163" "Aang" "  When are they coming?"
"2164" "Aang" "  You can't give them more weapons."
"2165" "Aang" "  The deal's off!"
"2166" "Aang" "  Get out of here!  You're leaving empty handed!"
"2167" "Sokka" "  This is bad!  Very bad!"
"2168" "Katara" "  Aang, what are we gonna do?  How can we possibly keep them all away?"
"2169" "Aang" "  I'll tell ya how.   We have something they don't.   Air power!  We control the sky.  That' something the Fire Nation can't do.  We can win!"
"2170" "Aang" "  Good, we'll need it."
"2171" "Sokka" "  Thank you.  You're a genius!"
"2172" "Sokka" "  See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne, but once you did, it just kept going.   You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.  So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?"
"2173" "Katara" "  Ugh, if only we knew."
"2174" "Sokka" "  A lid is actually the answer.  If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon."
"2175" "Katara" "  Hmm.  That's actually pretty smart."
"2176" "Sokka" "  Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs.  Smoke, slime, fire and. . ."
"2177" "Katara" "  Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?"
"2178" "Aang" "  We'll have to start without him."
"2179" "Aang" "  We've got'em on the run!  We need more slime!  with blasts of air, but their central cabins of the tanks just flip over and they begin advancing again.  The shoot more fire blasts at Aang, who avoids them.  Cut to Katara on Appa flying next to Teo, all surveying the battlefield."
"2180" "Katara" "  Water?  Can you get me close to one?"
"2181" "Katara" "  Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?"
"2182" "Sokka" "  Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?"
"2183" "Sokka" "  Then I guess they won't see this coming."
"2184" "Sokka" "  Oh no!  That was the last one!"
"2185" "Sokka" "  Rotten eggs!"
"2186" "Sokka" "  There!  That's where the gas is escaping!"
"2187" "Sokka" "  It's the only bomb we've got!"
"2188" "Aang" "  Look!  They're retreating!"
"2189" "Sokka" "  We're going down!"
"2190" "Katara" "  No!  Sokka!  Hold on!"
"2191" "Sokka" "  Get ready!"
"2192" "Aang" "  You know what?  I'm really glad you guys all live here now.  It's like the hermit crab , maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home.  And now you protect each other."
"2193" "Sokka" "  Aang, you were right about air power.   As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!"
"2194" "Sokka" "  I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?"
"2195" "Aang" "  I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?"
"2196" "Sokka" "  I'd love to!  Climb on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!"
"2197" "Katara" "  Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight."
"2198" "Sokka" "  And for what?  We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe.  There's nothing up here."
"2199" "Katara" "  They're waterbenders!  We found the Water Tribe!"
"2200" "Aang" "  There it is!"
"2201" "Katara" "  The Northern Water Tribe. . ."
"2202" "Sokka" "  We're finally here. . ."
"2203" "Katara" "  I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!"
"2204" "Aang" "  We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!"
"2205" "Katara" "  This place is beautiful."
"2206" "Sokka" "  Yeh, she is."
"2207" "Iroh" "  Winter, spring, summer and fall.  Wi/bnter and spring, summer and fall.  Four seasons, four loves.  Four seasons, four loves."
"2208" "Sokka" "  Hi, there.  Sokka, Southern Water Tribe."
"2209" "Sokka" "  So. . .  uh. . .  you're a Princess!   You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!"
"2210" "Katara" "  Ha!  Prince of what?"
"2211" "Sokka" "  A lot of things!  Uh, do you mind?  I'm trying to have a conversation here!"
"2212" "Katara" "  My apologies, Prince Sokka."
"2213" "Sokka" "  So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile.  I'm thinking maybe we could. . .  do an activity together?"
"2214" "Katara" "  Very smooth."
"2215" "Aang" "  My friend and I can't wait to start training with you –  after we relax for a couple days."
"2216" "Zuko" "  For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn."
"2217" "Iroh" "  No, it's about our plans.  There's a bit of a problem."
"2218" "Zuko" "  What! ?"
"2219" "Iroh" "  I'm afraid so.  He's taking everyone.   Even the cook!"
"2220" "Zuko" "  I'm not.  They're antiques.  Just decorative."
"2221" "Iroh" "  Just rumors.  I don't think he is real."
"2222" "Katara" "  I've waited for this day my whole life!  I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!"
"2223" "Aang" "  Good morning, Master Pakku!"
"2224" "Aang" "  Uhh. . .  this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?"
"2225" "Katara" "  What do you mean you won't teach me?   I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!"
"2226" "Katara" "  But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!"
"2227" "Katara" "  I don't want to heal, I want to fight!"
"2228" "Katara" "  Well your rules stink!"
"2229" "Aang" "  Yeh!  They're not fair.  If you won't teach Katara, then –"
"2230" "Aang" "  Then I won't learn from you!"
"2231" "Katara" "  Wait!   Aang didn't mean that."
"2232" "Katara" "  You can't risk your training for me.  You have to learn from Master Pakku.  Even if he is a big jerk."
"2233" "Sokka" "  Princess Yue!  Good morning!   Hey, how about that picnic last night?  Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party."
"2234" "Sokka" "  Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left."
"2235" "Sokka" "  So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other."
"2236" "Sokka" "  Yes!  At. . .  a place!  For. . .  some time!"
"2237" "Sokka" "  Great!  I'll see you –  aahh!"
"2238" "Sokka" "  That's okay, it was worth it.   See you tonight."
"2239" "Katara" "  Um, hi.  Are you Yagoda?"
"2240" "Katara" "  I guess I am."
"2241" "Aang" "  I'm trying!"
"2242" "Katara" "  Thanks for the lesson."
"2243" "Katara" "  Huh?"
"2244" "Katara" "  No, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.  My grandmother gave my mother this necklace, and my mother passed it down to me."
"2245" "Katara" "  Wait, how do you know my Gran- Gran's name?"
"2246" "Katara" "  She never told me."
"2247" "Katara" "  If Gran- Gran was engaged, why did she leave?"
"2248" "Iroh" "  The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels."
"2249" "Zuko" "  Good riddance to those traitors."
"2250" "Iroh" "  It's a lovely night for a walk.  Why don't you join me?  It would clear your head.   Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark.  Whatever makes you happy."
"2251" "Zuko" "  Uncle?   Uncle, is that you?"
"2252" "Iroh" "  Zuko!"
"2253" "Iroh" "  Zuko. . ."
"2254" "Sokka" "  Hi, Princess Yue.   I made you something.  I carved it myself."
"2255" "Sokka" "  Actually, it's a fish , see it has a fin."
"2256" "Katara" "  How's warrior training going?"
"2257" "Aang" "  That bad?"
"2258" "Sokka" "  No, it's Princess Yue.  I don't get it.  One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!   So how's waterbending training?"
"2259" "Aang" "  Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl."
"2260" "Sokka" "  Why don't you just teach her, Aang?"
"2261" "Katara" "  Why didn't I think of that?   At night, you can teach whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku.  That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending.  Everyone's happy!"
"2262" "Sokka" "  I'm not happy."
"2263" "Katara" "  But you're never happy.  Come on, Aang."
"2264" "Aang" "  Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating."
"2265" "Katara" "  I got it!"
"2266" "Aang" "  That was amazing!"
"2267" "Katara" "  That wasn't me."
"2268" "Aang" "  I. . .  I was just showing Katara a few moves."
"2269" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, I –"
"2270" "Katara" "  Yes –  please!"
"2271" "Katara" "  Fine."
"2272" "Katara" "  No!  No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!"
"2273" "Aang" "  Uh, Katara. . ."
"2274" "Katara" "  I'll be outside –  if you're man enough to fight me!"
"2275" "Aang" "  I'm sure she didn't mean that."
"2276" "Sokka" "  Yeh, I think she did."
"2277" "Iroh" "  The Fire Lord will not be pleased he learns who was responsible."
"2278" "Iroh" "  Yes. . .   pirates!  We had a run in with them awhile back."
"2279" "Iroh" "  They wanted revenge."
"2280" "Iroh" "  Yes, I accept.  It will be an honor to serve as your general.   To the Fire Nation!"
"2281" "Sokka" "  Are you crazy, Katara?  You're not gonna win this fight!"
"2282" "Katara" "  I know!  I don't care!"
"2283" "Aang" "  You don't have to do this for me.  I can find another teacher."
"2284" "Katara" "  I'm not doing it for you!  Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!"
"2285" "Katara" "  So, you decided to show up?   Aren't you gonna fight?"
"2286" "Katara" "  You can't knock me down!"
"2287" "Aang" "  Go Katara!"
"2288" "Katara" "  But you still won't teach me, will you?"
"2289" "Katara" "  Come back here!  I'm not finished yet!"
"2290" "Katara" "  No it's not, it's mine!  Give it back!"
"2291" "Katara" "  My Gran- Gran was supposed to marry you?"
"2292" "Iroh" "  Our plan is working perfectly.  Zhao doesn't suspect a thing."
"2293" "Zuko" "  You didn't have to do this."
"2294" "Iroh" "  No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!"
"2295" "Zuko" "  Thank you, Uncle."
"2296" "Iroh" "  Someone's coming!   Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours!  Good luck!"
"2297" "Katara" "  But she didn't love you, did she?  It was an arranged marriage."
"2298" "Katara" "  Gran- Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.  That's why she left.  It must have taken a lot of courage."
"2299" "Aang" "  Go get her."
"2300" "Sokka" "  Nothing.  I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful. . .  and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me."
"2301" "Sokka" "  No, no, see, that's the thing.  I think I do understand now.  You're a princess, and I. . .  I'm just a southern peasant."
"2302" "Sokka" "  It's okay.  You don't have to say anything.   I'll see ya around, okay?"
"2303" "Sokka" "  Okay, now I'm really confused!  Happy –  but confused!"
"2304" "Aang" "  Hey Katara!"
"2305" "Aang" "  Good to see ya here."
"2306" "Katara" "  You too."
"2307" "Aang" "  Yes, Master Pakku?"
"2308" "Aang" "  I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out!"
"2309" "Sokka" "  Are you kidding?  I grew up in a block of ice.  It's not exactly a cultural hub."
"2310" "Sokka" "  What's wrong?  We're taking a walk!"
"2311" "Sokka" "  I know what you need!   You need to meet my good friend Appa!"
"2312" "Sokka" "  Appa and I go way back.  Don't we boy? ."
"2313" "Sokka" "  Ahh!  Easy!"
"2314" "Sokka" "  Down boy!  Ahh!  No!  Up!"
"2315" "Sokka" "  You hangin' on tight?"
"2316" "Sokka" "  Yip. . .   . . . yip!"
"2317" "Sokka" "  Yeh, we pretty much live up here."
"2318" "Sokka" "  Not when you're with someone."
"2319" "Sokka" "  Yeh."
"2320" "Sokka" "  Whoo!  Yeh!  Good times!  Good times!"
"2321" "Sokka" "  Hey, look!"
"2322" "Sokka" "  Oh no."
"2323" "Sokka" "  Soot."
"2324" "Sokka" "  I've seen it before.  Right before my village was attacked.  It's soot mixed with snow."
"2325" "Sokka" "  It's the Fire Nation.  They've closed in on the North Pole.  And from the looks of the stuff. . ."
"2326" "Sokka" "  . . . I'd say there's a lot of them."
"2327" "Iroh" "  Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.  History is not always kind to its subjects."
"2328" "Iroh" "  I hope not, for your sake."
"2329" "Iroh" "  We'll be landing soon.  Do you have a plan?"
"2330" "Zuko" "  I'm working on it, Uncle.  Master Pakku and Sokka, Yue in tow.  The Princess stops, bringing Sokka to a halt along with her."
"2331" "Sokka" "  What?  We're just friends."
"2332" "Sokka" "  You don't love him, do you?  You don't even seem to like him."
"2333" "Sokka" "  You're not marrying them."
"2334" "Sokka" "  Count me in."
"2335" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"2336" "Aang" "  I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.   I'm gonna make a difference this time."
"2337" "Aang" "  Yip!  Yip!"
"2338" "Sokka" "  Katara! ?"
"2339" "Aang" "  I'll take it from here, boy!"
"2340" "Aang" "  Appa!"
"2341" "Aang" "  Thanks for the rescue, buddy!"
"2342" "Aang" "  You have got to be kidding me."
"2343" "Sokka" "  Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that."
"2344" "Sokka" "  When, like a hundred years ago?"
"2345" "Sokka" "  The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.  The newer uniforms are more streamlined."
"2346" "Sokka" "  His name is Zhao.  Middle- aged.  Big sideburns.  Bigger temper."
"2347" "Sokka" "  Princess Yue's marrying you?"
"2348" "Sokka" "  Nothing, congratulations."
"2349" "Iroh" "  It's almost twilight, Admiral.  As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack.  The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight.  You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak."
"2350" "Katara" "  Aang!"
"2351" "Aang" "  I can't do it.   I can't do it."
"2352" "Katara" "  What happened?"
"2353" "Aang" "  I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them.  I can't fight them all."
"2354" "Aang" "  I'm just one kid."
"2355" "Iroh" "  If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew, you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape."
"2356" "Zuko" "  I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle."
"2357" "Iroh" "  I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son. . ."
"2358" "Zuko" "  Uncle, you don't have to say it."
"2359" "Iroh" "  I think of you as my own."
"2360" "Zuko" "  I know, Uncle.   We'll meet again. . ."
"2361" "Zuko" "  . . . after I have the Avatar."
"2362" "Iroh" "  Remember your Breathe of Fire!  It could save your life out there!"
"2363" "Zuko" "  I will."
"2364" "Iroh" "  And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!"
"2365" "Zuko" "  I'll be fine."
"2366" "Sokka" "  Perks! ?  What does that mean?"
"2367" "Sokka" "  Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!"
"2368" "Sokka" "  You're just a jerk without a soul!  No offense!"
"2369" "Sokka" "  It's Admiral Zhao!"
"2370" "Zuko" "  Where are they going?  They're coming up for air somewhere. . ."
"2371" "Katara" "  I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night."
"2372" "Aang" "  The Spirits!  Maybe I can find them and get their help!"
"2373" "Katara" "  The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World.  Aang can talk to them!"
"2374" "Aang" "  Or, maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!"
"2375" "Aang" "  Or wisdom.  That's good too."
"2376" "Katara" "  The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.  How are you going to get there this time?"
"2377" "Aang" "  So is this the way to the Spirit World?"
"2378" "Katara" "  It's so warm here!  How is that possible?"
"2379" "Aang" "  You're right, Yue.  I can feel. . . something. . . it's so. . . tranquil."
"2380" "Zuko" "  Be quiet!"
"2381" "Sokka" "  Oh no!  Hahn's out there on the top secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang.  Everything's fine!"
"2382" "Sokka" "  What?  You want me to scrub the barracks?"
"2383" "Sokka" "  Er, sure.  That shouldn't be too hard."
"2384" "Katara" "  He's meditating –  trying to cross over into the Spirit World.  It takes all his concentration."
"2385" "Aang" "  How 'bout some quiet! ?   C'mon guys!  I can hear every word you're saying!"
"2386" "Katara" "  He's crossing into the Spirit World.  He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.  That's his way back to the physical world."
"2387" "Katara" "  No, he's my friend.  I'm perfectly capable of protecting him."
"2388" "Zuko" "  Well, aren't you a big girl now?"
"2389" "Katara" "  No!"
"2390" "Zuko" "  Yes!  Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you."
"2391" "Zuko" "  I see you've learned a new trick.  But I didn't come this far to lose to you."
"2392" "Zuko" "  You little peasant.  You've found a master, haven't you?"
"2393" "Zuko" "  You rise with the moon.  I rise with the sun."
"2394" "Katara" "  Aang!"
"2395" "Sokka" "  What happened?  Where's Zuko?"
"2396" "Katara" "  He took Aang.  He took him right out from under me."
"2397" "Sokka" "  Where did they go?"
"2398" "Katara" "  I can't believe I lost him."
"2399" "Sokka" "  You did everything you could and now we need to do everything we can to get him back."
"2400" "Sokka" "  Zuko can't have gotten far.  We'll find him.  Aang's gonna be fine."
"2401" "Katara" "  Okay."
"2402" "Katara" "  It's all right.  You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back."
"2403" "Sokka" "  Yip!  Yip!"
"2404" "Aang" "  Hello?  I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits."
"2405" "Aang" "  Yes!  I need –"
"2406" "Aang" "  Come back!"
"2407" "Aang" "  Roku!"
"2408" "Zuko" "  Shelter!"
"2409" "Aang" "  Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack.  I need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!"
"2410" "Aang" "  Who?"
"2411" "Zuko" "  I finally have you.  But I can't get you home because of this blizzard.   There's always something.  Not that you would understand.  You're like my sister.  Everything always. . . came easy to her.  She's a firebending prodigy –  and everyone adores her.   My father says she was born lucky.  He says I was lucky to be born.   I don't need luck though, I don't want it.  I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong.  It's made me who I am."
"2412" "Iroh" "  I don't need to remind you we have a time limit.   If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises they will be undefeatable."
"2413" "Iroh" "  Remove the moon! ?  How?"
"2414" "Iroh" "  What?"
"2415" "Iroh" "  Zhao, the Spirits are not to be trifled with!"
"2416" "Aang" "  Oh!  Whew!  You're just a curly tailed blue nose."
"2417" "Aang" "  Show no fear.  Show no emotion at all."
"2418" "Aang" "  Hello?  I'm looking for a spirit named Koh."
"2419" "Aang" "  Thank you."
"2420" "Aang" "  You know me?"
"2421" "Aang" "  I didn't know that.  Why did he. . .  or I. . .  try to kill you?"
"2422" "Zuko" "  Guess we'll be here awhile."
"2423" "Katara" "  I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard.  I'm worried that they won't."
"2424" "Sokka" "  They're not gonna die in this blizzard.  If we know anything it's that Zuko never gives up.  They'll survive –  and we'll find them!"
"2425" "Aang" "  I need to find the Moon and the Ocean."
"2426" "Aang" "  Please, help me find them.  An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help."
"2427" "Aang" "  What do you mean?  How can I find them and protect them?"
"2428" "Aang" "  The koi fish!"
"2429" "Aang" "  I must be going now."
"2430" "Aang" "  The spirits are in trouble.  I need to get back to the physical world."
"2431" "Aang" "  Hei- Bai!"
"2432" "Aang" "  This is where I came in.   But how do I get back?"
"2433" "Aang" "  Momo!"
"2434" "Aang" "  Momo?   Oh no!  Where's my body?"
"2435" "Katara" "  Look!  That's gotta be Aang!"
"2436" "Zuko" "  Welcome back."
"2437" "Aang" "  Good to be back."
"2438" "Zuko" "  That won't be enough to escape."
"2439" "Aang" "  Appa!"
"2440" "Zuko" "  Here for a rematch?"
"2441" "Katara" "  Trust me, Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match."
"2442" "Sokka" "  Hey!  This is some quality rope!"
"2443" "Aang" "  We need to get to the oasis!  The spirits are in trouble!"
"2444" "Aang" "  Wait, we can't just leave him here."
"2445" "Sokka" "  Sure we can.  Let's go."
"2446" "Aang" "  No, if we leave him, he'll die."
"2447" "Sokka" "  Yeh, this makes a lot of sense.  Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!"
"2448" "Sokka" "  Are you okay?"
"2449" "Aang" "  I feel it too.   The Moon Spirit is in trouble."
"2450" "Sokka" "  What do you mean?"
"2451" "Aang" "  Zhao!  Don't!"
"2452" "Aang" "  Destroying the moon won't just hurt the Water Tribe.  It will hurt everyone –  including you.  Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance.  You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world."
"2453" "Iroh" "  He is right, Zhao!"
"2454" "Iroh" "  I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too.  We all depend on the balance."
"2455" "Iroh" "  Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten- fold!   LET IT GO, NOW!"
"2456" "Aang" "  No, it's not over."
"2457" "Zuko" "  You tried to have me killed!"
"2458" "Zuko" "  I had no choice!"
"2459" "Katara" "  It's too late.  It's dead."
"2460" "Iroh" "  You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.  Some of its life is in you!"
"2461" "Sokka" "  No!  You don't have to do that!"
"2462" "Sokka" "  I won't let you!  Your father told me to protect you!"
"2463" "Sokka" "  NO!"
"2464" "Sokka" "  She's gone.   She's gone."
"2465" "Zuko" "  Take my hand!"
"2466" "Katara" "  What about Aang?   He still needs to learn waterbending."
"2467" "Sokka" "  You must be proud."
"2468" "Iroh" "  I'm surprised, Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar."
"2469" "Zuko" "  I'm tired."
"2470" "Iroh" "  Then you should rest.  A man needs his rest."
"2471" "Katara" "  You too, Momo."
"2472" "Aang" "  Come here."
"2473" "Aang" "   Aaahhh!   Oof!"
"2474" "Katara" "  Aang?"
"2475" "Katara" "  Do you wanna talk about it?"
"2476" "Aang" "  Nah.  Just a nightmare."
"2477" "Aang" "   I was in the Avatar state, but I was outside my body watching myself.  It was scary.  I was scary."
"2478" "Katara" "   Thank you, Master Pakku."
"2479" "Aang" "  Appa, yip yip!"
"2480" "Katara" "   Say hi to Gran Gran for me!"
"2481" "Iroh" "   Aaahhh. . .  this is what I've been missing.  Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?"
"2482" "Iroh" "  I see.  It's the anniversary, isn't it?"
"2483" "Zuko" "   Three years ago today I was banished.  I lost it all.    I want it back.  I want the Avatar, I want my honor, I want my throne.  I want my father not to think I'm worthless."
"2484" "Iroh" "   I'm sure he doesn't!  Why would he banish you if he didn't care?"
"2485" "Iroh" "   Erg. . .  that came out wrong, didn't it?"
"2486" "Sokka" "   There it is!"
"2487" "Katara" "   Mighty Katara?  I like that."
"2488" "Sokka" "  Not bad, not bad."
"2489" "Aang" "   I try not to think about it too much."
"2490" "Aang" "   What? !  No I'm not!"
"2491" "Katara" "  Aang still needs to master all four elements."
"2492" "Sokka" "  But, sir, the thing is Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar state."
"2493" "Aang" "  See, it's this special state where—"
"2494" "Aang" "   Right. . .  but I'm don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar state, much less what to do once I'm there."
"2495" "Katara" "   No, nothing's decided.  We already have a plan.  Aang's pursuing his destiny his way."
"2496" "Aang" "   General Fong?"
"2497" "Aang" "   I'm in.   I'll fight the Fire Lord."
"2498" "Aang" "   I told the general I'd help him. . .  by going into the Avatar state."
"2499" "Katara" "  Aang, no.  This is not the right way."
"2500" "Sokka" "  Why not?  Remember when he took out the Fire Navy?  He was incredible."
"2501" "Katara" "  There's a right way to do this.  Practice, study, and discipline."
"2502" "Sokka" "  Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord."
"2503" "Katara" "   If you two meatheads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine.  Go ahead and glow it up!"
"2504" "Aang" "   Katara, I'm just being realistic.  I don't have time to do this the right way."
"2505" "Aang" "  Ten- fold energy, huh?"
"2506" "Aang" "   Is it working, is it working?  I can't tell!  Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar state 'cause I don't have a good view of myself!  Am I talking too loud?"
"2507" "Sokka" "   I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death."
"2508" "Aang" "   Ooof!"
"2509" "Sokka" "  Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar state."
"2510" "Aang" "   I love surprises."
"2511" "Aang" "  Aaahhh!   Still not glowing."
"2512" "Aang" "  This is just mud!"
"2513" "Aang" "  Aaaaachoooo!"
"2514" "Iroh" "  Look at these magnificent shells!  I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come."
"2515" "Zuko" "  We don't need anymore useless things.  You forget we have to carry everything ourselves now."
"2516" "Zuko" "   What are you doing here?"
"2517" "Zuko" "   Don't call me that!"
"2518" "Iroh" "  To what do we owe this honor?"
"2519" "Iroh" "  I'm sure your brother just needs a moment to—"
"2520" "Zuko" "   Father regrets?  He. . .  wants me back?"
"2521" "Katara" "   Can we talk about something?"
"2522" "Aang" "   Sure."
"2523" "Katara" "  Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?  It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you.  I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore.  I'm not saying the Avatar state doesn't have incredible— and helpful power.  But you have to understand, for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary."
"2524" "Aang" "  I'm really glad you told me that.  But I still need to do this."
"2525" "Katara" "  I don't understand."
"2526" "Aang" "  No, you don't.  Every day more and more people die.  I'm already a hundred years late.  Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war.  I have to try it."
"2527" "Katara" "   I can't watch you do this to yourself.  I'm not coming tomorrow.   Goodnight."
"2528" "Aang" "   Goodnight."
"2529" "Zuko" "   We're going home.  After three long years.  It's unbelievable."
"2530" "Iroh" "   It is unbelievable.  I have never known my brother to regret anything."
"2531" "Zuko" "  Did you listen to Azula?  Father's realized how important family is to him.  He cares about me."
"2532" "Iroh" "  I care about you.  And if Ozai wants you back. . .  well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine."
"2533" "Zuko" "   You don't know how my father feels about me.   You don't know anything."
"2534" "Iroh" "   Zuko, I only meant that in our family things are not always what they seem."
"2535" "Zuko" ""
"2536" "Aang" "   Aaahhh!"
"2537" "Aang" "   Sokka.  Sokka, wake up."
"2538" "Sokka" "   Wha. . . ?"
"2539" "Aang" "  I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar state."
"2540" "Sokka" "  You sure?"
"2541" "Aang" "  Yes."
"2542" "Sokka" "   Okay."
"2543" "Aang" "   Do you think the general will be mad?"
"2544" "Sokka" "  What can he say?  You're the Avatar.  Who knows better than you?"
"2545" "Iroh" "   Wait!   Don't leave without me!"
"2546" "Zuko" "   Uncle!  You've changed your mind!"
"2547" "Iroh" "  Family sticks together, right?"
"2548" "Zuko" "  We're finally going home."
"2549" "Aang" "  The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose.  So, I guess that's it."
"2550" "Aang" "  I'm sure.  I can only reach the Avatar state when I'm in genuine danger."
"2551" "Aang" "   Ugh!"
"2552" "Sokka" "  Aang!"
"2553" "Aang" "   Aaahhh!"
"2554" "Aang" "  I am not your enemy!  I won't fight you!"
"2555" "Aang" "  You can't fight forever!"
"2556" "Zuko" "   Home. . ."
"2557" "Zuko" "  You lied to me!"
"2558" "Aang" "  Aaahhh!"
"2559" "Katara" "  I wonder what crazy thing they're trying now.   Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay."
"2560" "Katara" "   What's going on?"
"2561" "Sokka" "  The general's gone crazy.  He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar state!"
"2562" "Sokka" "   Good bird/horse thingy."
"2563" "Katara" "  Aaahhh!   I can't move!"
"2564" "Aang" "  Don't hurt her!"
"2565" "Katara" "   Aaahhh!"
"2566" "Sokka" "  Katara!  No!   Waaaahhh!  Oof!"
"2567" "Aang" "  Stop this!  You have to let her go."
"2568" "Aang" "   I'm trying. . .  I'm trying!"
"2569" "Katara" "  Aang, I'm sinking!"
"2570" "Katara" "   Aaahhh!  Please!"
"2571" "Aang" "   You don't need to do this!"
"2572" "Iroh" "  Zuko!  Let's go!"
"2573" "Aang" "  What do you mean?"
"2574" "Aang" "   I'm sorry, Katara.  I hope you never have to see me like that again."
"2575" "Aang" "  You're out of your mind."
"2576" "Sokka" "   Anybody got a problem with that?"
"2577" "Katara" "  I think we're all set."
"2578" "Iroh" "  I think we're safe here."
"2579" "Sokka" "  You guys are gonna be done soon, right?"
"2580" "Sokka" "  We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to Omashu today."
"2581" "Katara" "   What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?"
"2582" "Sokka" "  I can be ready in two minutes.  Seriously.   Whenever."
"2583" "Aang" "  So, you were showing me the octopus form."
"2584" "Katara" "  Right.  Let me see your stance.   Your arms are too far apart.  See, if you move them closer together you protect your center.  You got it?"
"2585" "Aang" "   Oh. . .  yeah.  Thanks."
"2586" "Katara" "  Okay, let's see what you got."
"2587" "Katara" "  You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang."
"2588" "Katara" "   We're not river people."
"2589" "Aang" "  Just. . .  people."
"2590" "Sokka" "   Who're you?"
"2591" "Aang" "  You guys are nomads That's great!  I'm a nomad."
"2592" "Aang" "   I know. . .  you just said that."
"2593" "Zuko" "   I didn't find anything to eat.  I can't live like this.  I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.   This is impossible!"
"2594" "Zuko" "   Uncle. . .  what are you doing?"
"2595" "Iroh" "  You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.   Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking!   That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous."
"2596" "Zuko" "  We need food, not tea.  I'm going fishing."
"2597" "Iroh" "   Delectable tea?  Or deadly poison?"
"2598" "Aang" "  Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories.  These guys have been everywhere."
"2599" "Aang" "  They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler."
"2600" "Sokka" "   Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me.   We need to get to Omashu.   No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows."
"2601" "Sokka" "   O.  Ma.  Shu."
"2602" "Katara" "  Sokka's right.  We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe."
"2603" "Katara" "   Is this real or a legend?"
"2604" "Sokka" "  I think we'll just stick with flying.  We've dealt with the Fire Nation before.  We'll be fine."
"2605" "Aang" "  Yeah.  Thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable."
"2606" "Sokka" "   Secret love cave.  Let's go."
"2607" "Iroh" "  Zuko, remember that plant that I thought might be tea?"
"2608" "Zuko" "   You didn't!"
"2609" "Iroh" "  I did.   And it wasn't."
"2610" "Zuko" "   Yah!"
"2611" "Iroh" "   When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.   But look what I found!  These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant.  That, or macahoni berries that cause blindness."
"2612" "Zuko" "   We're not taking any more chances with these plants!  We need to get help."
"2613" "Iroh" "  But where are we going to go?  We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation."
"2614" "Zuko" "   If the Earth Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed."
"2615" "Iroh" "  But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula."
"2616" "Zuko" "  Earth Kingdom it is."
"2617" "Sokka" "  How far are we from the tunnel."
"2618" "Sokka" "  Labyrinth !"
"2619" "Sokka" "   Curse!"
"2620" "Sokka" "  What exactly is this curse?"
"2621" "Sokka" "   That's it!  There's no way we're going througbrh some cursed hole!"
"2622" "Katara" "  That's no campfire, Moku."
"2623" "Sokka" "  That's Fire Nation.  They're tracking us."
"2624" "Aang" "  So all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves?"
"2625" "Aang" "  We can make it."
"2626" "Sokka" "  Everyone into the hole!"
"2627" "Katara" "   It's okay, Appa.  We'll be fine.   I hope."
"2628" "Sokka" "  We will be fine.  All we need is a plan.  Chong, how long do those torches last?"
"2629" "Sokka" "   It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!"
"2630" "Sokka" "  I'm gonna make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been.  Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through."
"2631" "Iroh" "   Heh heh heh.  Whoops!"
"2632" "Zuko" "   Yes, we're travelers."
"2633" "Zuko" "   Names Of course we have names.  I'm. . .  Lee.  And this is my uncle, uh. . .  Mushi."
"2634" "Iroh" "   Yes, but my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior."
"2635" "Iroh" "  Where do you live, exactly?"
"2636" "Katara" "  Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to."
"2637" "Sokka" "  This doesn't make any sense; we already came through this way."
"2638" "Aang" "  Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also."
"2639" "Sokka" "  There's something strange here.  There's only one explanation.  The tunnels are changing."
"2640" "Zuko" "  I haven't seen my father in many years."
"2641" "Zuko" "  Yeah."
"2642" "Sokka" "   Right.  If only we listened to you."
"2643" "Katara" "  Everyone be quiet.  Listen."
"2644" "Sokka" "  Noooooooo!"
"2645" "Katara" "  Aang, look!"
"2646" "Aang" "  We found the exit!"
"2647" "Katara" "  This isn't the exit."
"2648" "Aang" "  No. . .  it's a tomb."
"2649" "Aang" "  It must be the two lovers from the legend.  That's who's buried here."
"2650" "Katara" "  These pictures tell their story."
"2651" "Katara" "   They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages."
"2652" "Katara" "   The villages were enemies so they could not be together."
"2653" "Katara" "   But their love was strong and they found a way."
"2654" "Katara" "   The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger moles.  They became the first earthbenders."
"2655" "Katara" "   They built elaborate tunnels so they could meet secretly.  Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth."
"2656" "Katara" "   But one day the man didn't come."
"2657" "Katara" "  He died in the war between their two villages."
"2658" "Katara" "   Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power.  She could have destroyed them all."
"2659" "Katara" "   But instead she declared the war over."
"2660" "Katara" "  Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace."
"2661" "Katara" "   The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu.  The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love."
"2662" "Katara" "   Love is brightest in the dark."
"2663" "Sokka" "   At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku."
"2664" "Sokka" "   Yes!  We're all thinking of ideas!"
"2665" "Aang" "  How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels?"
"2666" "Katara" "  I have a crazy idea."
"2667" "Aang" "  What?"
"2668" "Katara" "   Never mind, it's too crazy."
"2669" "Aang" "  Katara, what is it?"
"2670" "Katara" "  I was thinking. . .  the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love."
"2671" "Aang" "  Right. . ."
"2672" "Katara" "  And here it says 'love is brightest in the dark' and. . .   has a picture of them kissing."
"2673" "Aang" "   Where are you going with this?"
"2674" "Katara" "   Well. . .  what if we kissed?"
"2675" "Aang" "   Us, kissing?"
"2676" "Katara" "  See?  It was a crazy idea."
"2677" "Aang" "   Us. . .  kissing. . ."
"2678" "Katara" "   Us kissing.  What was I thinking?  Can you imagine that?"
"2679" "Aang" "   Yeah, heh, heh.   I definitely wouldn't wanna kiss you!"
"2680" "Katara" "   Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.   Sorry I suggested it!"
"2681" "Aang" "   No, no, I mean. . .  if there was a choice between kissing you and dying. . ."
"2682" "Aang" "  What?  I'm saying I'd rather kiss you than die.   That's a compliment."
"2683" "Katara" "   Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do!"
"2684" "Aang" "   What is wrong with me?"
"2685" "Iroh" "   Thank you for the duck.  It was excellent."
"2686" "Iroh" "   Much practice.   Junior, where are your manners?  You need to thank these nice people."
"2687" "Zuko" "   Thank you."
"2688" "Zuko" "   I know."
"2689" "Iroh" "   What are you doing?  These people just showed you great kindness."
"2690" "Zuko" "  They're about to show us a little more kindness.   Well?"
"2691" "Aang" "   We're gonna run out of light any second now, aren't we?"
"2692" "Katara" "  I think so."
"2693" "Aang" "  Then what are we gonna do?"
"2694" "Katara" "  What can we do?"
"2695" "Sokka" "  No, they were trying to get away from something."
"2696" "Sokka" "   Badger moles, coming toward me.  Come on guys, help me out."
"2697" "Aang" "  It's made of some kind of crystals.  They must only light up in the dark!"
"2698" "Katara" "  That's how the two lovers found each other.  They just put out their lights and followed the crystals."
"2699" "Katara" "  That must be the way out!"
"2700" "Aang" "   So. . .  um. . ."
"2701" "Katara" "   Let's go!"
"2702" "Aang" "   What about Sokka?"
"2703" "Katara" "  Sokka!"
"2704" "Sokka" "  How did you guys get out?"
"2705" "Aang" ""
"2706" "Sokka" "  Really?  We let huge ferocious beasts lead our way."
"2707" "Katara" "  Why is your forehead all red?"
"2708" "Aang" "  So, are you guys gonna come to Omashu with us?"
"2709" "Aang" "  Okay.  Thanks for everything, Moku."
"2710" "Sokka" "   Just play your songs."
"2711" "Sokka" "  The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about -  the destination."
"2712" "Sokka" "  I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O. . .   Oh, no. . ."
"2713" "Aang" "  I can't believe it.  I know the war has spread far,  but Omashu always seemed. . . untouchable."
"2714" "Sokka" "  Up until now, it was.  Now Ba- Sing- Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left."
"2715" "Katara" "  This is horrible, but we have to move on."
"2716" "Aang" "   No.  I'm going in to find Bumi."
"2717" "Sokka" "  Aang, stop.  We don't even know if Bumi's still. . ."
"2718" "Aang" "   What?  If he's still what?"
"2719" "Sokka" "   . . . around."
"2720" "Katara" "  I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people around who can teach you earthbending."
"2721" "Aang" "  This isn't about finding a teacher.  This is about finding my friend."
"2722" "Sokka" "   A secret passage?"
"2723" "Sokka" "  Why didn't we just use this last time?   Ugh!"
"2724" "Aang" "  Does that answer your question?"
"2725" "Sokka" "  Ew!"
"2726" "Katara" "  That wasn't as bad as I thought."
"2727" "Sokka" "  Aaahhh!"
"2728" "Sokka" "  Aaahh!  Aahhh!  They won't let go!  Help!  Aaaak!"
"2729" "Aang" "  Stop making so much noise.  It's just a purple pentapus."
"2730" "Katara" "  Sorry.  We were just on our way home."
"2731" "Katara" "  Uh. . . he has pentapox, sir."
"2732" "Katara" "   Um. . . it's highly contagious!"
"2733" "Sokka" "  Uuuuuu. . . . It's so awful. . . I'm dyiiiing. . ."
"2734" "Katara" "  . . . and deadly. . ."
"2735" "Aang" "  Thank you, sewer friend!"
"2736" "Katara" "  Let's find Bumi and get out of here."
"2737" "Sokka" "  Where would they be keeping him?"
"2738" "Aang" "  Somewhere he can't earthbend.   Somewhere made of metal."
"2739" "Aang" "  So, is King Bumi with you guys?  Is he leading the resistance?"
"2740" "Aang" "  Actually there's another path to freedom.  You could leave Omashu.  You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.   But you're outnumbered.  You can't win.  Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day."
"2741" "Sokka" "  Suckers!"
"2742" "Sokka" "  You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox."
"2743" "Sokka" "  The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta ACT sick, too.  Ya gotta sell it!"
"2744" "Sokka" "   Now that's what I'm talkin' about."
"2745" "Sokka" "  Okay everyone!  Into sick formation."
"2746" "Katara" "  Aang, what are you doing?  Aren't you coming with us."
"2747" "Aang" "   No.  I'm not leaving until I find Bumi."
"2748" "Aang" "  Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later."
"2749" "Aang" "  Flopsie!"
"2750" "Aang" "   Come on, Flopsie.  You gotta help me find Bumi.  Yip Yip!  Oh. . . I guess that doesn't work with you.  Let's go!"
"2751" "Aang" "   We looked everywhere.  No Bumi."
"2752" "Katara" "  Oh no.  Did someone get left behind?"
"2753" "Sokka" "  No!  Bad Fire Nation baby!"
"2754" "Sokka" "  Oh. . . alright."
"2755" "Katara" "   Ooo, you're so CUTE.  Mmmmm. . ."
"2756" "Katara" "   Does that look like the face of a killer to you?"
"2757" "Aang" "  It's from the Fire Nation governor.  He thinks we kidnapped his son.  So. . . he wants to make a trade.  His son  for King Bumi."
"2758" "Aang" "  I don't think so.  I'm sure the Governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi.  It's a new day.   I have a good feeling about this."
"2759" "Aang" "  He's here.  We're ready to trade."
"2760" "Aang" "  Bumi!"
"2761" "Aang" "  Hang on!  We're gonna get you out of here."
"2762" "Katara" "  We've got to get the baby out of here!"
"2763" "Sokka" "   Way ahead of ya!"
"2764" "Aang" "   Just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?"
"2765" "Aang" "   It's good to see you too!"
"2766" "Sokka" "  I seem to manage!"
"2767" "Katara" "  There's Aang!"
"2768" "Sokka" "  We can catch him!"
"2769" "Aang" "  Hang on, Bumi!  Our ride's here!"
"2770" "Aang" "  You could earthbend all along! ?"
"2771" "Aang" "  I don't understand.   Why didn't you free yourself?  Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded?  What's the matter with you, Bumi! ?"
"2772" "Aang" "  I know!   There's positive jin when you're attacking, and negative jin when you're retreating."
"2773" "Aang" "   There are three jins?"
"2774" "Aang" "   That's why you surrendered, isn't it?"
"2775" "Aang" "  I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending."
"2776" "Aang" "  Hey, Momo!"
"2777" "Iroh" "  Spare coins for weary travelers?"
"2778" "Zuko" "  This is humiliating!  We're royalty.  These people should be giving us whatever we want."
"2779" "Iroh" "  They will -  if you ask nicely."
"2780" "Iroh" "   Spare change for a hungry old man?"
"2781" "Iroh" "  The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile."
"2782" "Zuko" "  We're not performers."
"2783" "Iroh" "  Not professional, anyway."
"2784" "Iroh" "   It's a long, long way to Ba- Sing- Se,  but the girls in the city they look soo prett- ay!"
"2785" "Iroh" "   And they kiss so sweet that you've really got to meet the girls from Ba- Sing- Se!"
"2786" "Iroh" "   Such a kind man!"
"2787" "Sokka" "   Hey, you takin' us down for a reason?"
"2788" "Sokka" "   Aang!   Why are we going down?"
"2789" "Aang" "  What?   I didn't even notice."
"2790" "Sokka" "  Are you noticing now?"
"2791" "Katara" "   Is something wrong?"
"2792" "Aang" "   I know this is gonna sound weird, but. . .  I think the swamp is. . .  calling to me."
"2793" "Sokka" "   It is telling ya where we can get something to eat?"
"2794" "Aang" "  No, I. . .  I think it wants us to land there."
"2795" "Sokka" "  No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on."
"2796" "Aang" "  I don't know. . .  Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth.  Do you want me to ignore it?"
"2797" "Sokka" "  Yes!"
"2798" "Katara" "  I don't know. . .  There's something ominous about that place."
"2799" "Sokka" "  See Even Appa and Momo don't like it here."
"2800" "Aang" "  Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this. . .  bye swamp."
"2801" "Aang" "  Yip!  Yip!"
"2802" "Sokka" "  You better throw in an extra yip!  We gotta move!"
"2803" "Aang" "  Where's Appa and Momo?"
"2804" "Aang" "   Appa!  Momo!"
"2805" "Katara" "  Sokka!  You've got an elbow leech!"
"2806" "Sokka" "   Where!  Where!"
"2807" "Katara" "  Where do you think?"
"2808" "Sokka" "   Why do things keep attaching to me!"
"2809" "Katara" "  You couldn't find them?"
"2810" "Aang" "  No. . .  and the tornado. . .  it just disappeared."
"2811" "Sokka" "  We better speed things up!"
"2812" "Aang" "   Maybe. . .  we should be a little nicer to the swamp."
"2813" "Sokka" "   Aang, these are just plants!  Do you want me to say please and thank you as I swing my machete back and forth?"
"2814" "Katara" "   Maybe you should listen to Aang.   Something about this place feels. . .  alive."
"2815" "Sokka" "   I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here, and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can."
"2816" "Katara" "   Appa!  Momo!"
"2817" "Sokka" "  There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them.  We'll have to make camp for the night."
"2818" "Katara" "  What was that!"
"2819" "Sokka" "  Nothing.  Just swamp gas.   Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here."
"2820" "Sokka" "  I think we should build a fire. . ."
"2821" "Aang" "  Sokka, the longer we're here the more I think you shouldn't be doing that."
"2822" "Sokka" "   No, I asked the swamp.  It said this was fine.   Right, swamp?   No problem, Sokka!"
"2823" "Katara" "  Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?"
"2824" "Sokka" "  Please, we're all alone out here."
"2825" "Aang" "  . . . except for them."
"2826" "Sokka" "   Right, except for them."
"2827" "Aang" "  Guys?"
"2828" "Katara" "   Aang?   Sokka?"
"2829" "Katara" "  Hello?  Hello?  Can you help me?   Mom?   Mom!"
"2830" "Katara" "  I can't believe. . ."
"2831" "Sokka" "  Aang!   Stupid swamp!  Dumb, ugly vines!  Katara!   You think you're so tough, huh?"
"2832" "Sokka" "  Hello?   Yue?   This is just a trick of the light. . .  swamp gas. . .   I. . .  hit my head running away last night.  I'm going crazy."
"2833" "Aang" "   Katara!  Appa!"
"2834" "Aang" "  Hello?"
"2835" "Aang" "   Who are you?"
"2836" "Aang" "  Hey, come back!"
"2837" "Aang" "  Who are you?"
"2838" "Sokka" "  What do you guys think you're doing!  I've been looking all over for you!"
"2839" "Katara" "   Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!"
"2840" "Aang" "   I was chasing some girl."
"2841" "Katara" "  What girl?"
"2842" "Aang" "   I don't know.  I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress."
"2843" "Sokka" "   Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!"
"2844" "Katara" "   I thought I saw Mom."
"2845" "Sokka" "   Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us.  That's why we all saw things out here."
"2846" "Katara" "  You saw something too?"
"2847" "Sokka" "   I thought I saw Yue.  But, that doesn't prove anything.   Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot."
"2848" "Aang" "  What about me?  I didn't know the girl I saw.  And all our visions led us right here."
"2849" "Katara" "  Okay. . .  so where's here?   The middle of the swamp?"
"2850" "Aang" "  Yeh, the center. . ."
"2851" "Aang" "   It's the heart of the swamp,  it's been calling us here,  I knew it."
"2852" "Sokka" "   It's just a tree.  It can't call anyone!  For the last time, there's nothing after us  and there's nothing magical happening here."
"2853" "Sokka" "  There's someone in there!  He's bending the vines!"
"2854" "Aang" "   Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us?"
"2855" "Aang" "  We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land."
"2856" "Sokka" "  He's the Avatar.  Stuff like that happens to us -  a lot."
"2857" "Katara" "  So, who are you then?"
"2858" "Sokka" "   See?  Completely reasonable.  Not a monster , just a regular guy defending his home.  Nothing mystical about it."
"2859" "Sokka" "  Sure ya did.  It seems real chatty."
"2860" "Aang" "  I get how the tree is one big thing, but, the whole world?"
"2861" "Katara" "  But what did our visions mean?"
"2862" "Aang" "  But what about my vision It was someone I had never met."
"2863" "Aang" "   Time is an illusion. . .  so, it's. . .   someone I will meet?"
"2864" "Sokka" "  Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to Appa and Momo."
"2865" "Aang" "  I think I know how to find them.   Everything is connected."
"2866" "Aang" "  Come on!  We've got to hurry!"
"2867" "Aang" "  Appa!"
"2868" "Katara" "  Hey, you guys are waterbenders!"
"2869" "Sokka" "  Hue?"
"2870" "Sokka" "   Tastes just like arctic hen.   So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?   You've got plenty of those big things wandering around."
"2871" "Sokka" "  Nice Slim!"
"2872" "Katara" "  The South Pole."
"2873" "Katara" "  No, it' all ice and snow."
"2874" "Sokka" "   Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.  Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp."
"2875" "Katara" "  What about the visions?"
"2876" "Sokka" "  I told you, we were hungry.  I'm eating a giant bug!"
"2877" "Aang" "  But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?"
"2878" "Sokka" "  That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.   The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down."
"2879" "Sokka" "   Well, no accounting for weather.  Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp."
"2880" "Sokka" "   What are you doing in my mouth!"
"2881" "Sokka" "  Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries."
"2882" "Sokka" "  Come on, come on, come on!"
"2883" "Katara" "  My scrolls!"
"2884" "Aang" "  My staff!"
"2885" "Aang" "  Yip, yip!"
"2886" "Sokka" "  Wait, my boomerang!"
"2887" "Katara" "  There's no time!"
"2888" "Sokka" "  Oh, I see.  There's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?"
"2889" "Katara" "   That's correct!"
"2890" "Sokka" "   Oh."
"2891" "Aang" "   Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka."
"2892" "Sokka" "  I feel like I've lost part of my identity.  Imagine if you lost your arrow, or if Katara lost her. . .   . . .  hair loopies."
"2893" "Sokka" "   I used to be boomerang guy. . ."
"2894" "Katara" "  I hope that's okay."
"2895" "Aang" "  Avatar Day?"
"2896" "Aang" "  There's a holiday for the Avatar.  Who knew?"
"2897" "Katara" "  Look!  They made a giant Kyoshi float."
"2898" "Sokka" "  And here comes Avatar Roku."
"2899" "Aang" "  Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated."
"2900" "Sokka" "  And it's nice to appreciate their deep- fried festival food."
"2901" "Katara" "  Aang, look!"
"2902" "Aang" "   That's the biggest me I've ever seen."
"2903" "Sokka" "  Now a torch; that's a nice prop.  It's bright, dangerous. . .  . . .  smells manly.  But I'm not sure I could carry it off."
"2904" "Katara" "  Hey, what's that guy doing?"
"2905" "Iroh" "  Where did you get these?"
"2906" "Zuko" "   What does it matter where they came from?"
"2907" "Iroh" "   Hmm. . .   Mmmm!"
"2908" "Aang" "  That party- pooper's my friend!"
"2909" "Aang" "   No, I'm not, I. . ."
"2910" "Katara" "  Why not?  Aang helps people."
"2911" "Aang" "  It's true.   I'm on your side."
"2912" "Aang" "  You think that I. . .  murdered someone. . ."
"2913" "Aang" "   Huh!"
"2914" "Katara" "   Aang would never do something like that.  No Avatar would.   And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!"
"2915" "Aang" "   Give me a chance to clear my name."
"2916" "Aang" "   I'll gladly stand trial."
"2917" "Aang" "  No problem!"
"2918" "Aang" "  How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?"
"2919" "Sokka" "  So some people don't like you.  Big deal!  There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you.  Now let's bust you out of here."
"2920" "Aang" "  I can't."
"2921" "Sokka" "   Sure you can!  A little. . .  swish, swish, swish!  Airbending slice!  . . .  and we're on our way."
"2922" "Katara" "   I think what Master Swish is trying to say is that you're supposed to be out saving the world.  You can't do that locked up in here."
"2923" "Aang" "  I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer, either.  I need you guys to help prove my innocence."
"2924" "Sokka" "  How're we gonna do that?  The crime happened over three hundred years ago."
"2925" "Aang" "   That's okay, Sokka.  For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective."
"2926" "Sokka" "   Well, I guess I could be classified as such."
"2927" "Katara" "   Yeah!  Back home he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky."
"2928" "Sokka" "   Everyone wanted to blame it on a polar leopard, but I figured out that it was Old Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots.  See, a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.  Okay, I guess I am pretty good."
"2929" "Aang" "  So you'll help me with my case?"
"2930" "Sokka" "  Fine.  But I'm gonna need some new props."
"2931" "Sokka" "  I'm ready."
"2932" "Sokka" "  What?"
"2933" "Sokka" "  This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone.  And we know that the statue was built after Chin died."
"2934" "Katara" "   So if they were built at the same time, that means. . ."
"2935" "Sokka" "   Shhh!  I wanna solve it!  That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple."
"2936" "Katara" "  That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence."
"2937" "Sokka" "  You're right."
"2938" "Sokka" "  We need to go to Kyoshi Island."
"2939" "Katara" "  Where'd you get that?"
"2940" "Katara" "  He couldn't be here, Koko."
"2941" "Katara" "  Oyagi!  Aang is in jail.  The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life."
"2942" "Sokka" "   They say it was Kyoshi."
"2943" "Sokka" "   So, uh. . .  what's Suki up to?  Is she around?"
"2944" "Sokka" "   Oh, well. . .  that's great."
"2945" "Katara" "   She had exquisite taste."
"2946" "Sokka" "   These fans. . .  they were her weapons, no?"
"2947" "Katara" "  These were her boots?  Her feet must have been enormous!"
"2948" "Katara" "   Wait a minute. . .  big feet?   Little footprints?   There's no way!"
"2949" "Sokka" "  Ahem.   Special outfit Hat and pipe These things mean anything to you?"
"2950" "Katara" "   You're right.  I'm sorry.  Please."
"2951" "Sokka" "   Aha!  There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene!"
"2952" "Katara" "   Brilliant, Sokka."
"2953" "Aang" "   You think so?"
"2954" "Aang" "   I don't know. . ."
"2955" "Aang" "   You guys are great."
"2956" "Sokka" "   Three hundred and seventy years. . .  wait,  are you sure it was today?"
"2957" "Sokka" "  This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise; it took place at sunset.  Look at the shadows."
"2958" "Katara" "  They point east.  So the sun must have been in the west."
"2959" "Sokka" "   If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime.   She has an alibi!"
"2960" "Katara" "   Honorable mayor,  we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar.  We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence."
"2961" "Aang" "  Then how can I prove my innocence?"
"2962" "Sokka" "   You can do it, Aang.  Just remember the evidence."
"2963" "Aang" "  Right. . .  evidence.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to tell you what really happened.  And I will prove it with facts.  Fact number one. . .   Uh. . ."
"2964" "Sokka" "   The footprints!"
"2965" "Aang" "  Oh, yeah. . .   You see, I have very large feet."
"2966" "Aang" "   Furthermore, your. . .  temple matches your statue.  But. . .  I was in a painting at sunset.   So there you have it!  I'm not guilty!"
"2967" "Sokka" "   He's dead."
"2968" "Iroh" "  Looks like you did some serious shopping.   But where did you get the money?"
"2969" "Zuko" "   Do you like your new teapot?"
"2970" "Iroh" "  To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.   I know we've had some difficult times lately.  We've had to struggle just to get by.   But it's nothing to be ashamed of.  There is a simple honor in poverty."
"2971" "Zuko" "  There's no honor for me without the Avatar."
"2972" "Iroh" "  Zuko. . .   Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems.  Not now."
"2973" "Zuko" "   Then there is no hope at all."
"2974" "Iroh" "   No, Zuko!  You must never give in to despair.  Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.   In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself.  That is the meaning of inner strength."
"2975" "Katara" "  Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony."
"2976" "Katara" "  This isn't just any witness.  I'm going to call. . .   Avatar Kyoshi herself!"
"2977" "Sokka" "   What are you doing?"
"2978" "Katara" "  Well, she is Aang's past life.  Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something."
"2979" "Sokka" "   I do believe in the power of stuff."
"2980" "Katara" "   Please!  If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here."
"2981" "Aang" "   Hey, everybody.   Avatar Kyoshi here."
"2982" "Aang" "   So. . .  what just happened?"
"2983" "Katara" "  Uhh. . .  you kind of confessed.  Sorry."
"2984" "Zuko" "  Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said."
"2985" "Iroh" "   You did?  Good, good."
"2986" "Zuko" "   It's helped me realize something.  We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together.  I need to find my own way."
"2987" "Iroh" "  Wait!"
"2988" "Aang" "  I said I would face justice, so I will."
"2989" "Katara" "   Community service!  Please stop on community service."
"2990" "Aang" "   Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil."
"2991" "Sokka" "   Boomerang!  You do always come back!"
"2992" "Sokka" "  What is this?"
"2993" "Katara" "   Happy Avatar Day, everyone."
"2994" "Sokka" "  This is by far the worst town we've ever been to. "
"2995" "Sokka" "   It's pricey, but I really do like it."
"2996" "Katara" "  Then you should get it.  You deserve something nice."
"2997" "Sokka" "   I do, don't I?   But no.  It's too expensive, I shouldn't."
"2998" "Katara" "   Alright, then don't."
"2999" "Sokka" "  You know what?  I'm gonna get it."
"3000" "Aang" "   Look, there's a coupon on the back.  The first lesson is free."
"3001" "Katara" "  Who knows?  This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for."
"3002" "Aang" "   He's not the one."
"3003" "Aang" "  Excuse me,  but where is this earthbending tournament exactly?"
"3004" "Sokka" "  Ha, ha!  Oh, I got to remember that one."
"3005" "Katara" "   I'll take care of this."
"3006" "Katara" "  Hey strong guys, wait up!"
"3007" "Sokka" "  What was I thinking?  I don't need a new bag.  Why'd you let me buy this?"
"3008" "Katara" "  You ready to find an earthbending teacher?  Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6!"
"3009" "Aang" "  How did you get them to tell you?"
"3010" "Katara" "  Oh,  a girl has her ways."
"3011" "Aang" "  Hey, front row seats!  I wonder why no one else is sitting here."
"3012" "Sokka" "  I guess that's why."
"3013" "Katara" "  This is just gonna be a bunch of guys chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it?"
"3014" "Sokka" "   That's what I paid for."
"3015" "Katara" "  How about The Boulder?  He's got some good moves."
"3016" "Aang" "   I don't know.  Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth.  He's just listening to his big muscles.  What do you think, Sokka?"
"3017" "Sokka" "   Ha ha!  Whoo!"
"3018" "Sokka" "   Boo!  Boo!"
"3019" "Sokka" "  Go back to the Fire Nation!"
"3020" "Sokka" "   Yeah!  Whoo!  The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt!   Yeah!  Whoo!"
"3021" "Katara" "  She can't really be blind.   It's just part of her character, right?"
"3022" "Aang" "  I think she is."
"3023" "Sokka" "  I think she is. . .   going down!"
"3024" "Toph" "   Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder."
"3025" "Toph" "   Whenever you're ready. . . The Pebble.   Ha ha ha!"
"3026" "Sokka" "   No!"
"3027" "Katara" "   How did she do that?"
"3028" "Aang" "  She waited,  and listened."
"3029" "Aang" "  I will!"
"3030" "Sokka" "   Go Aang!  Avenge The Boulder!"
"3031" "Toph" "  Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?"
"3032" "Aang" "  I don't really want to fight you.  I want to talk to you."
"3033" "Sokka" "  Boo!  No talking!"
"3034" "Katara" "   Don't boo at him!"
"3035" "Toph" "  Somebody's a little light on his feet.  What's your fighting name,  The Fancy Dancer?"
"3036" "Toph" "  Where'd you go?"
"3037" "Aang" "  Please, wait!"
"3038" "Toph" "  There you are!"
"3039" "Aang" "  Please listen!  I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you."
"3040" "Toph" "  Whoever you are, just leave me alone."
"3041" "Aang" "  Wait!"
"3042" "Sokka" "  Way to go, champ!"
"3043" "Sokka" "  I gotta admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag.  It matches the belt perfectly."
"3044" "Katara" "   That is a big relief."
"3045" "Aang" "  If we want to find The Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a good place to start."
"3046" "Katara" "  Yeah, I didn't think so."
"3047" "Sokka" "  Nicely done."
"3048" "Aang" "  We need to talk to her.  Do you guys know where she lives?"
"3049" "Katara" "  Let me handle this.   You're not telling us everything!"
"3050" "Aang" "   That's because we're asking about the wrong person.  In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar.  Know anybody like that?"
"3051" "Aang" "  Flying boar is good enough for me.   Let's check it out."
"3052" "Katara" "  Hey, I've got my eye on you."
"3053" "Sokka" "   Water Tribe."
"3054" "Aang" "  That's the flying boar from my vision.  Come on."
"3055" "Toph" "  What are you doing here, twinkle toes?"
"3056" "Aang" "  How did you know it was me?"
"3057" "Sokka" "   Don't answer to twinkle toes.  It's not manly!"
"3058" "Katara" "  You're the one whose bag matches his belt."
"3059" "Toph" "  How did you find me?"
"3060" "Aang" "   Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth.  And then I had a vision in a magic swamp and. . ."
"3061" "Katara" "   What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar, and if he doesn't master earthbending soon he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord."
"3062" "Toph" "  Not my problem.  Now get out of here or I'll call the guards."
"3063" "Sokka" "  Look, we all have to do our part to win this war.  And yours is to teach Aang earthbending."
"3064" "Toph" "  Guards!  Guards, help!"
"3065" "Toph" "  I thought I heard someone.  I got scared."
"3066" "Aang" "  Allow me."
"3067" "Aang" "  I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but  I can't do that  without finding an earthbending teacher first."
"3068" "Aang" "  Then she must be a great earthbender,  probably good enough to teach someone else."
"3069" "Aang" "  Ow!"
"3070" "Aang" "  Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is."
"3071" "Toph" "  What's your problem?"
"3072" "Aang" "  What's your problem? Mrs."
"3073" "Aang" "  Good night, buddy."
"3074" "Toph" "  Relax.  Look, I'm sorry about dinner.  Let's call a truce, ok?"
"3075" "Toph" "  Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing."
"3076" "Toph" "  I see with earthbending.  It's kind of like seeing with my feet.  I can feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is.  You, that tree, even those ants."
"3077" "Aang" "  That's amazing."
"3078" "Toph" "   My parents don't understand.  They've always treated me like I was helpless."
"3079" "Aang" "  Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?"
"3080" "Toph" "  Yeah."
"3081" "Aang" "  Then why stay here where you're not happy?"
"3082" "Toph" "  They're my parents.  Where else am I supposed to go?"
"3083" "Aang" "   You could come with us."
"3084" "Toph" "  Yeah.  You guys get to go wherever you want.  No one telling you what to do, that's the life.  It's just not my life."
"3085" "Toph" "  We're being ambushed."
"3086" "Katara" "   If you want to see your daughter again, bring  500 gold pieces to the arena.   It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder."
"3087" "Sokka" "   I can't believe it."
"3088" "Sokka" "   I have the Boulder's autograph!"
"3089" "Katara" "   We're going with you. Mrs."
"3090" "Toph" "  You think you're so tough. . ."
"3091" "Toph" "  . . . why don't you come up here so I can smack that grin off your face?"
"3092" "Sokka" "  Here's your money.  Now let them go."
"3093" "Katara" "  What about Aang?"
"3094" "Aang" "  Go.  I'll be ok."
"3095" "Katara" "  Toph, there's too many of them.  We need an earthbender.  We need you!"
"3096" "Toph" "  Yes, I can."
"3097" "Toph" "   Let him go.  I beat you all before,  and I'll do it again."
"3098" "Toph" "  Wait."
"3099" "Toph" "   They're mine."
"3100" "Aang" "  Hit it harder!"
"3101" "Sokka" "  I'm trying!"
"3102" "Toph" "  Dad, I know it's hard for you to see me this way, but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me.  I love fighting.  I love being an earthbender.  And I'm really, really good at it.  I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world.  You were doing it to protect me.  But I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend.  So now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me."
"3103" "Toph" "   It has?"
"3104" "Toph" "  But dad! Mrs."
"3105" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, Toph."
"3106" "Toph" "  I'm sorry, too.  Goodbye, Aang."
"3107" "Katara" "  Don't worry.  We'll find you a teacher.   There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there."
"3108" "Aang" "  Not like her."
"3109" "Aang" "  Toph!  What are you doing here?"
"3110" "Toph" "  My dad changed his mind.  He said I was free to travel the world."
"3111" "Sokka" "   Well, we'd better get out of here -  before your dad changes his mind again."
"3112" "Toph" "  Good idea."
"3113" "Aang" "  You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph."
"3114" "Toph" "   Speaking of which, I want to show you something."
"3115" "Aang" "  Okay."
"3116" "Toph" "  Now we're even."
"3117" "Toph" "  Um, I'll take the belt back."
"3118" "Toph" "  Ow!"
"3119" "Sokka" "  Sorry."
"3120" "Zuko" "  Could I get some water, a bag of feed, and something hot to eat?"
"3121" "Zuko" "  No."
"3122" "Zuko" "   No."
"3123" "Zuko" "   Maybe a chicken flew over."
"3124" "Zuko" "  No kidding."
"3125" "Zuko" "  I'm, uh. . ."
"3126" "Zuko" "  I can't.  I should be moving on."
"3127" "Zuko" "  Uh- uh."
"3128" "Zuko" "  Far away."
"3129" "Zuko" "  Hey mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?"
"3130" "Zuko" "  Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that?"
"3131" "Zuko" "   I am not cart wheeling."
"3132" "Zuko" "  I don't care.  I don't want to play with you."
"3133" "Zuko" "   Girls are crazy!"
"3134" "Iroh" "   If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.   I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first."
"3135" "Zuko" "   Never give up without a fight."
"3136" "Zuko" "  How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?"
"3137" "Zuko" "   You're holding them all wrong."
"3138" "Zuko" "  Keep in mind, these are dual swords.   Two halves of a single weapon.  Don't think of them as separate, because they're not.  They're just two different parts of the same whole."
"3139" "Zuko" "  Trouble."
"3140" "Zuko" "  No.  I need to move on.  Here.   I want you to have this.  Read the inscription."
"3141" "Zuko" "  The other one."
"3142" "Zuko" "   Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!"
"3143" "Zuko" "  Does that mean we won the war?"
"3144" "Zuko" "  What are you talking about?  Uncle's not a quitter."
"3145" "Zuko" "   How do you know what he should do?   He's probably just sad his only kid is gone. . .  forever."
"3146" "Zuko" "  Great Grandfather won, because. . ."
"3147" "Zuko" "  I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning."
"3148" "Zuko" "   I failed."
"3149" "Zuko" "  What are you. . . ?"
"3150" "Zuko" "   Ha- ha, Azula.  Nice try."
"3151" "Zuko" "  Liar!"
"3152" "Zuko" "  Stop it, you're lying!   Dad would never do that to me."
"3153" "Zuko" "   Azula always lies. . .  Azula always lies. . ."
"3154" "Zuko" "  Azula always lies. . ."
"3155" "Zuko" "  I'll get your son back."
"3156" "Zuko" "   Let the kid go."
"3157" "Zuko" "  It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are.  You're not soldiers.   You're bullies.  Freeloaders, abusing your power.  Mostly over women and kids.  You don't want Lee in your army.  You're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war."
"3158" "Zuko" "   Mom?"
"3159" "Zuko" "   My name is Zuko.  Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.   Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne."
"3160" "Zuko" "  It's yours.  You should have it."
"3161" "Zuko" "  Mom?  Mom, mom!"
"3162" "Zuko" "   Where's mom?"
"3163" "Zuko" "  Not funny, Azula.  You're sick.  And I want my knife back, now."
"3164" "Zuko" "  Where is she?"
"3165" "Toph" "  Hey, you guys picked a great campsite.   The grass is so soft."
"3166" "Sokka" "  That's not grass.  Appa's shedding."
"3167" "Katara" "   Oh, gross!"
"3168" "Aang" "  That's not gross; it's just a part of spring."
"3169" "Aang" "  You know, rebirth, flowers blooming, and Appa gets a new coat!"
"3170" "Katara" "  Ah, the beauty of spring.   Stop, Appa, stop!"
"3171" "Sokka" "  It's not that bad, Katara.   It makes a great wig!"
"3172" "Aang" "   And a great beard!"
"3173" "Katara" "   I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting."
"3174" "Toph" "  Excuse me,  does anyone have a razor. . .   . . . because I've got some hairy pits!"
"3175" "Katara" "  So, Toph, usually when setting up camp we try to divide up the work."
"3176" "Toph" "   Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go."
"3177" "Katara" "   Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is, uh, some of us might fetch water while someone else might set up the fire pit or put up the tent.   Even Momo does his fair share."
"3178" "Toph" "   Katara, I'm fine.  I can carry my own weight.  I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look,  my tent's all set up."
"3179" "Katara" "   Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish. . ."
"3180" "Toph" "   I don't understand.  What's the problem here?"
"3181" "Katara" "  Never mind."
"3182" "Sokka" "  Aaaah!"
"3183" "Aang" "   Sorry!"
"3184" "Katara" "  Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier.  I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves."
"3185" "Toph" "  Yeah, you do seem pretty tired."
"3186" "Katara" "   I meant all of us."
"3187" "Toph" "  Well, goodnight."
"3188" "Katara" "   Goodnight."
"3189" "Toph" "  There's something coming toward us!"
"3190" "Aang" "  What is it?"
"3191" "Toph" "  It feels like an avalanche. . .   But also not like an avalanche."
"3192" "Sokka" "  Your powers of perception are frightening."
"3193" "Katara" "  Should we leave?"
"3194" "Aang" "  Better safe than sorry."
"3195" "Katara" "  What is that thing?"
"3196" "Toph" "  Ahh, land, sweet land!   See you guys in the morning!"
"3197" "Katara" "  Actually, can you help us unload?"
"3198" "Toph" "   Really?  You need me to help unload Sokka's funky- smelling sleeping bag?"
"3199" "Katara" "  Well, yeah.   That and everything else.  You're a part of our team now and. . ."
"3200" "Toph" "   Look.   I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff.  I'm carrying my own weight."
"3201" "Katara" "   That's not the point."
"3202" "Katara" "  Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful."
"3203" "Toph" "  What?   Look here, sugar queen,  I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending, so don't you talk to me about being selfish!"
"3204" "Katara" "  Sugar Queen!   D- Did you just slam the door in my face!"
"3205" "Katara" "  How can you be so infuriating!"
"3206" "Aang" "   Should we. . .  do something?"
"3207" "Sokka" "  Hey, I'm just enjoying the show."
"3208" "Aang" "  Okay, okay, you both need to calm down."
"3209" "Katara" "   Both?   I'm completely calm!"
"3210" "Aang" "  I. . .  can see that."
"3211" "Katara" "  The stars sure are beautiful tonight."
"3212" "Katara" "  Too bad you can't see them, Toph!"
"3213" "Sokka" "  Hey, how is a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling and earthquaking!"
"3214" "Toph" "  That thing is back!"
"3215" "Sokka" "  Well, how far away is it?   Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes."
"3216" "Aang" "   I don't think so, Sokka."
"3217" "Katara" "  Seriously, what is that thing?"
"3218" "Toph" "  And how does it keep finding us?"
"3219" "Aang" "  I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em."
"3220" "Sokka" "  Okay, forget about setting up camp.  I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep."
"3221" "Katara" "   That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway."
"3222" "Toph" "   Oh, I didn't realize baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed."
"3223" "Aang" "   Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what  or who it is."
"3224" "Katara" "  It could be Zuko.  We haven't seen him since the North Pole."
"3225" "Toph" "  Who's Zuko?"
"3226" "Sokka" "   Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world."
"3227" "Katara" "   What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?"
"3228" "Sokka" "   This is a warrior's wolf tail."
"3229" "Katara" "  Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky!"
"3230" "Sokka" "  Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have followed us here.  So. . .  now would everyone just  shhh!   No, Momo, ssh!  Sleepy time."
"3231" "Sokka" "  Aww, don't tell me. . ."
"3232" "Aang" "  That's impossible.  There's no way they could have tracked us."
"3233" "Toph" "  I can feel it with my own two feet!"
"3234" "Katara" "  Let's get out of here!"
"3235" "Aang" "  Maybe we should face them.  Find out who they are.  Who knows, maybe they're friendly."
"3236" "Sokka" "  Always the optimist."
"3237" "Katara" "  It's those three girls from Omashu!"
"3238" "Toph" "  We can take 'em.  Three on three."
"3239" "Sokka" "  Actually, Toph, there's four of us."
"3240" "Toph" "  Oh.  I'm sorry, I didn't count you.  You know, no bending and all."
"3241" "Sokka" "   I can still fight!"
"3242" "Toph" "  Okay.  Three on three plus Sokka."
"3243" "Sokka" "  Well, we wanted to find out who they were.  We found out.   Now let's get out of here."
"3244" "Aang" "  Appa, yip yip!"
"3245" "Katara" "  I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu."
"3246" "Toph" "  I still think we could've taken them."
"3247" "Katara" "  Are you kidding?  The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them  one of those girls did something that took my bending away.  That's scary."
"3248" "Sokka" "  Oh no, the sun is rising!   We've been up all night with no sleep."
"3249" "Aang" "  Sokka, we'll be okay."
"3250" "Sokka" "   Are you sure! ?  I've never not slept before!  What if I fall asleep now and something happens?  And something always happens!"
"3251" "Katara" "   Every time we land, those girls are there, so we'll just have to keep flying."
"3252" "Aang" "   We can't keep flying forever."
"3253" "Aang" "   So, what's the plan?"
"3254" "Toph" "  Don't know. . .  too tired to think."
"3255" "Katara" "  I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap."
"3256" "Sokka" "  Yes!  Sleep!"
"3257" "Toph" "  What's going on!"
"3258" "Aang" "  Appa fell asleep!"
"3259" "Aang" "  Wake up, buddy!"
"3260" "Aang" "  Appa's exhausted."
"3261" "Sokka" "  Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them.  The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep."
"3262" "Katara" "  Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier  if Toph didn't have such issues."
"3263" "Toph" "   What! ?"
"3264" "Aang" "  Alright, alright!  Everyone's exhausted.  Let's just get some rest."
"3265" "Toph" "  No!  I want to hear what Katara has to say.  You think I have issues?"
"3266" "Katara" "   I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out earlier we could've set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!"
"3267" "Toph" "  You're blaming me for this! ?"
"3268" "Aang" "  No, no!  She's not blaming you!"
"3269" "Katara" "  No, I'm blaming her!"
"3270" "Toph" "  Hey!"
"3271" "Toph" "  I never asked you for diddly doo da.  I carry my own weight!"
"3272" "Toph" "  Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here!"
"3273" "Aang" "  What?  You're blaming Appa? !"
"3274" "Toph" "  Yeah!  You wanna know how they keep finding us?"
"3275" "Toph" "  He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!"
"3276" "Aang" "  How dare you blame Appa!  He saved your life three times today!  If there's anyone to blame, it's you!  You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not!  He is!  Appa's carrying your weight!   He never had a problem flying when  it was just the three of us!"
"3277" "Toph" "  I'm outta here."
"3278" "Sokka" "  Wait."
"3279" "Aang" "  What did I just do! ?"
"3280" "Aang" "  I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher.  Now she's gone."
"3281" "Katara" "  I know.  We're all just trying to get used to each other, and I was so mean to her."
"3282" "Sokka" "   Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks."
"3283" "Katara" "   Thanks, Sokka."
"3284" "Sokka" "  No problem."
"3285" "Katara" "  We need to find Toph and apologize."
"3286" "Sokka" "  Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?"
"3287" "Aang" "  I have a plan."
"3288" "Aang" "  Toph was right.  Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us.  But now that he's clean, no more trail!"
"3289" "Katara" "  Are you sure that he's okay to fly?"
"3290" "Aang" "   He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.   I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course."
"3291" "Iroh" "  Ohhh. . .  That really hurt my tailbone."
"3292" "Katara" "  How did they find us?"
"3293" "Sokka" "  Appa, come on!  We need to go faster!"
"3294" "Katara" "  He's too tired!"
"3295" "Sokka" "  Not good, not good!"
"3296" "Sokka" "  We just need to make it across that river!"
"3297" "Katara" "  Come on, Appa, just a little further!"
"3298" "Sokka" "   We made it!  We're safe!"
"3299" "Katara" "   You did it, Appa!"
"3300" "Sokka" "  Good try, but no."
"3301" "Sokka" "  How ya doing?"
"3302" "Katara" "   Well, you know!"
"3303" "Sokka" "  Thanks Appa.  I don't know what we'd do without you."
"3304" "Aang" "  Alright, you've caught up with me.  Now who are you and what do you want?"
"3305" "Aang" "  So what now?"
"3306" "Aang" "   I'm not running."
"3307" "Iroh" "  Here is your tea.  You seem a little too young to be traveling alone."
"3308" "Toph" "   You seem a little too old."
"3309" "Iroh" "   Perhaps I am."
"3310" "Toph" "  I know what you're thinking.  I look like I can't handle being by myself."
"3311" "Iroh" "  I wasn't thinking that."
"3312" "Toph" "  You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea."
"3313" "Iroh" "  I poured your tea because I wanted to  and for no other reason."
"3314" "Toph" "  People see me and think I'm weak.  They want to take care of me.  But I can take care of myself by myself."
"3315" "Iroh" "  You sound like my nephew.   Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support.  There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you.   Not that I love you; I just met you."
"3316" "Toph" "   So, where is your nephew?"
"3317" "Iroh" "  I've been tracking him, actually."
"3318" "Toph" "  Is he lost?"
"3319" "Iroh" "   Yes, a little bit.  His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times.  He is trying to figure out who he is and he went away."
"3320" "Toph" "  So. . .  now you're following him."
"3321" "Iroh" "  I know he doesn't want me around right now, but, if he needs me, I'll be there."
"3322" "Toph" "  Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.   Thank you."
"3323" "Iroh" "  My pleasure.  Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights."
"3324" "Toph" "  No, thank you for what you said.  It helped me."
"3325" "Iroh" "  I'm glad."
"3326" "Toph" "  Oh, and about your nephew?  Maybe you should tell him that you need him too."
"3327" "Zuko" "  Yes,  I really do."
"3328" "Aang" "  Zuko!"
"3329" "Aang" "   Zuzu?"
"3330" "Zuko" "  Back off, Azula!  He's mine!"
"3331" "Aang" "  Katara!"
"3332" "Zuko" "  Uncle. . ."
"3333" "Iroh" "  Get up!"
"3334" "Toph" "  I thought you guys could use a little help."
"3335" "Katara" "   Thanks."
"3336" "Zuko" "  Get away from us!"
"3337" "Katara" "  Zuko, I can help!"
"3338" "Zuko" "  Leave!"
"3339" "Aang" "  Today's the day!  Can you believe it?  After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending!  And this place. . .  i- it's perfect!  Don't you think, Sokka?"
"3340" "Aang" "  Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?"
"3341" "Aang" "   Sorry!"
"3342" "Toph" "  Good morning, earthbending student!"
"3343" "Aang" "  Good morning, sifu Toph."
"3344" "Katara" "   Hey. . .  you never call me sifu Katara."
"3345" "Aang" "  Well, if you think I should. . ."
"3346" "Toph" "  Sorry, snoozles.  We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can."
"3347" "Aang" "  So what move are you going to teach me first?  Rockalanche?   The trembler?   Oh!  Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!"
"3348" "Toph" "  Let's start with move a rock."
"3349" "Aang" "  Sounds good!  Sounds good!"
"3350" "Toph" "  The key to earthbending is your stance.   You've got to be steady and strong.  Rock is a stubborn element.   If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself."
"3351" "Aang" "  Like a rock.  Got it."
"3352" "Toph" "  Good.  Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.   Okay, you ready to give it a try?"
"3353" "Aang" "  I'm ready."
"3354" "Sokka" "  Rock beats airbender!"
"3355" "Iroh" "  My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again."
"3356" "Zuko" "  Uncle!"
"3357" "Zuko" "  You were unconscious.  Azula did this to you."
"3358" "Zuko" "  It was a surprise attack."
"3359" "Iroh" "  Somehow, that's not so surprising."
"3360" "Zuko" "  I hope I made it the way you like it."
"3361" "Iroh" "  Mmm, good.   That was very, uhh. . .  bracing!"
"3362" "Zuko" "  So uncle, I've been thinking.  It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again.  I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her."
"3363" "Iroh" "  No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.   It's time to resume your training."
"3364" "Katara" "  I don't understand what went wrong.   He did it exactly the way you did."
"3365" "Aang" "  Maybe there's another way.   What if I came at the boulder from a different angle?"
"3366" "Toph" "  No, that's the problem.  You've got to stop thinking like an airbender.   There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.   You've got to face it head on.  And when I say head on, I mean like this!"
"3367" "Aang" "  Whoa!"
"3368" "Katara" "  I've been training Aang for a while now.  He really responds well to a positive teaching experience.  Lots of encouragement and praise.  Kind words.  If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction."
"3369" "Toph" "  Thanks, Katara.  A gentle nudge.  I'll try that.   Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!"
"3370" "Toph" "  Rocklike!"
"3371" "Toph" "  Rocklike!"
"3372" "Sokka" "  You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat.  Just a bit closer. . ."
"3373" "Sokka" "  Gotcha!   You are a lucky little meat creature."
"3374" "Iroh" "  Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression.  It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is.  Some call lightning the cold- blooded fire.   It is precise and deadly, like Azula.  To perform the technique requires peace of mind."
"3375" "Zuko" "  I see."
"3376" "Iroh" "  Oh yeah, good point!  I mean, yes."
"3377" "Iroh" "  There is energy all around us.   The energy is both yin and yang; positive energy and negative energy.   Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies.  This creates an imbalance.  The energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together.   You provide release and guidance, creating lightning."
"3378" "Zuko" "  I'm ready to try it!"
"3379" "Iroh" "   Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it.  You are simply its humble guide.  Breathe first."
"3380" "Toph" "  This time we're going to try something a little different.  Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock.   Get in your horse stance!   I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.   If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock.   Like this."
"3381" "Katara" "  Sorry, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending?"
"3382" "Toph" "  I'm glad you said something.   Actually, there is a better way.   This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it.  Thank you, Katara!"
"3383" "Aang" "   Yeah, thanks Katara!"
"3384" "Katara" "   Heh."
"3385" "Aang" "  I guess I just panicked.  I don't know what to say."
"3386" "Toph" "  There's nothing to say.  You blew it.  You had a perfect stance and perfect form but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts."
"3387" "Aang" "  I know.  I'm sorry."
"3388" "Toph" "  Yeah, you are sorry.  If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly- boned wimp!  Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender? !"
"3389" "Aang" "   No.  I don't think I do."
"3390" "Katara" "  Aang, it's no big deal.  You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready.  Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay?"
"3391" "Aang" "  Yeah. . .  that sounds good."
"3392" "Toph" "  Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better."
"3393" "Zuko" "  Why can't I do it?  Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face!  Like everything always does!"
"3394" "Iroh" "  I was afraid this might happen.  You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you."
"3395" "Zuko" "   What turmoil?"
"3396" "Iroh" "  Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away."
"3397" "Zuko" "  But I don't feel any shame at all!  I'm as proud as ever!"
"3398" "Iroh" "  Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source.  True humility is the only antidote to shame."
"3399" "Zuko" "  Well. . .  my life has been nothing but humbling lately."
"3400" "Iroh" "  I have another idea.  I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself!"
"3401" "Sokka" "  You probably think I deserve this, don't you?   Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things!  Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal.  But this time it didn't work out that way."
"3402" "Sokka" "  I admit it.  You're cute.   Okay, you've convinced me.  If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me.  No meat.  Even though meat is so tasty."
"3403" "Sokka" "   Hey, it looks like my karma is already paying off!"
"3404" "Sokka" "  That's okay!  I got it!"
"3405" "Sokka" "  Now come back, boomerang."
"3406" "Katara" "  You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?"
"3407" "Aang" "   I don't want to talk about it."
"3408" "Katara" "  You do know that's the problem, don't you?  If you face this issue instead of avoiding it. . ."
"3409" "Aang" "   I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright!   I need to face it head- on, like a rock.  But I just can't do it!  I don't know why I can't, but I can't."
"3410" "Katara" "  Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?"
"3411" "Aang" "  I guess it's earth."
"3412" "Katara" "  That's why it's so hard for you to get this.   You're working with your natural opposite.  But you'll figure it out.   I know you will.   Think fast!"
"3413" "Katara" "  Excellent.  You have the reflexes of a waterbending master."
"3414" "Aang" "  Thanks, Katara.  Sifu Katara."
"3415" "Iroh" "  Fire is the element of power.  The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.  Earth is the element of substance.  The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong.  They are persistent and enduring.  Air is the element of freedom.  The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.  Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!   Water is the element of change.  The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things.  They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything."
"3416" "Zuko" "  Why are you telling me these things?"
"3417" "Iroh" "  It is important to draw wisdom from many different places.  If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.   Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole."
"3418" "Zuko" "  All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff."
"3419" "Iroh" "  It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.  But, it can make you more powerful too.   You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders."
"3420" "Toph" "  Aang!  I found these nuts in your bag.   I figured you wouldn't mind.  And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it."
"3421" "Aang" "  As a matter of fact, I don't mind.  I'm happy to share anything I have."
"3422" "Toph" "  You know, I'm really glad you feel that way, because I also have this great new nutcracker."
"3423" "Aang" "  Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't. . .   That's an antique, hand crafted by the monks. . .   It's a delicate instrument!"
"3424" "Toph" "   It's not the only delicate instrument around here."
"3425" "Aang" "  Ohmmmm. . ."
"3426" "Katara" "  Hey Aang, have you seen. . ."
"3427" "Aang" "   Meditating here!"
"3428" "Katara" "  It's important.  It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet.  I think we should search for him."
"3429" "Aang" "  We'll find him faster if we split up."
"3430" "Sokka" "  Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm.  Okay?  OW!   That's all I got!  It's pretty much my whole identity!  Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!   But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow!  . . . Deal?"
"3431" "Sokka" "  Aang!  Thank goodness!  Have you got any meat?"
"3432" "Aang" "  Sokka!  Are you okay?"
"3433" "Sokka" "   Stop, stop!  You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!"
"3434" "Aang" "   Hmm. . .  I bet I can airbend you out of here."
"3435" "Sokka" "  Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here.  How about it?"
"3436" "Aang" "   I can't.  I can't do it."
"3437" "Aang" "  I can't do that either."
"3438" "Sokka" "  You can't?  Why not?"
"3439" "Aang" "  It would just be really. . .  uncomfortable."
"3440" "Sokka" "  Uncomfortable?   Well, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable."
"3441" "Aang" "  Thanks, Sokka.   This whole earthbending thing really has me confused.  There's so much pressure.  Everyone expects me to get it right away.  It puts me in a really awkward position."
"3442" "Sokka" "  Awkward position. . .  I think I know the feeling."
"3443" "Aang" "  If I try, I fail.  But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it.  I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place."
"3444" "Sokka" "  Hmm.  How about that.   Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops.  Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang."
"3445" "Aang" "  Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub."
"3446" "Sokka" "  Really?  He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion."
"3447" "Aang" "  It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in.  Whatcha doin' out here, little guy?  Did you lose your mama?"
"3448" "Iroh" "  Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy.  A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them.  I learned a way to do this with lightning."
"3449" "Zuko" "   You can teach me to redirect lightning?"
"3450" "Iroh" "  If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.   You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to your shoulder and down into your stomach.   The stomach is the source of energy in your body.  It is called the sea of chi.  Only in my case, it is more like a vast ocean.   You direct it up again and out the other arm.   The stomach detour is critical.  You must not let the lightning pass through your heart  or the damage could be deadly.  You may wish to try a physical motion to get a feel for the pathway's flow.  Like this.   Now, are you focusing your energy Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?"
"3451" "Zuko" "  I think so."
"3452" "Iroh" "  Come on.  You've got to feel the flow."
"3453" "Iroh" "  Excellent!  You've got it!"
"3454" "Zuko" "  Great!  I'm ready to try it with real lightning!"
"3455" "Iroh" "  What, are you crazy?  Lightning is very dangerous."
"3456" "Zuko" ""
"3457" "Iroh" "   But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you!   If you are lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all."
"3458" "Zuko" "  Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning."
"3459" "Aang" "   Hey, there. . .  we found your cub!   See?  We have no problem with you!  We're friendly."
"3460" "Sokka" "   Aang, this is bad!  You gotta get me outta here!"
"3461" "Sokka" "  This is really bad!   Please, Aang!  You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!"
"3462" "Aang" "  Oh no!   Whoo- hoo!  Look at me!"
"3463" "Sokka" "   Please don't leave me again."
"3464" "Aang" "   I won't."
"3465" "Sokka" "  What are you doing here?"
"3466" "Toph" "  Just enjoying the show."
"3467" "Aang" "  What?  You were there the whole time?"
"3468" "Toph" "  Pretty much."
"3469" "Aang" "   Why didn't you do something?  Sokka was in trouble!  I was in trouble!  You could've gotten him out and helped us get away!"
"3470" "Toph" "  I guess it just didn't occur to me."
"3471" "Aang" "   Enough!  I want my staff back!"
"3472" "Toph" "  Do it now."
"3473" "Aang" "   What?"
"3474" "Toph" "  Earthbend, twinkletoes.  You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me.  You've got the stuff."
"3475" "Aang" "  But. . ."
"3476" "Toph" "  DO IT!"
"3477" "Toph" "   You did it!  You're an earthbender."
"3478" "Aang" "   I can't believe it!"
"3479" "Sokka" "  Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment.  So, could you get me out of her so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?"
"3480" "Aang" "  No problem, Sokka!"
"3481" "Toph" "  Actually, you should probably let me do that.  You're still a little new to this.  You might accidentally crush him."
"3482" "Sokka" "  Yeah, no crushing, please."
"3483" "Katara" "  You found him!"
"3484" "Sokka" "  The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die, it makes a man think about what's really important.  I realized. . ."
"3485" "Aang" "   Hey, Katara, look what I can do!"
"3486" "Katara" "  You did it!  I knew you would!   You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?"
"3487" "Toph" "  Yep.  It worked wonders."
"3488" "Aang" "  Appa!  Appa!  I can earthbend now!  The key is being completely rooted!  Physically and mentally unmovable!"
"3489" "Zuko" "   You've always thrown everything you could at me!  Well, I can take it!  And now I can give it back!   Come on!  Strike me!  You've never held back before!  "
"3490" "Sokka" "   What's out here?"
"3491" "Toph" "   A lot actually.  There's hundreds of little-"
"3492" "Aang" "  Shhh!  I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise.  Just watch."
"3493" "Aang" "   Heheheha, yeah!"
"3494" "Aang" "  I'm putting an orchestra together."
"3495" "Sokka" "  Orchestra, huh?  Well la dee da."
"3496" "Sokka" "  This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about?  We should be making plans."
"3497" "Toph" "  We did make plans.  We're all picking mini- vacations."
"3498" "Sokka" "  There's no time for vacations."
"3499" "Aang" "   I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.   I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara.  I've been training my arrows off."
"3500" "Katara" "  Yeah.  What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime?"
"3501" "Sokka" "   Even if you do master all of the elements, then what?  It's not like we have a map of the fire nation.  Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?   Knock, knock!  Hello, Fire Lord?  Anybody home?   I don't think so.  We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war."
"3502" "Katara" "  Alright, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence."
"3503" "Aang" "   Your turn, Katara.   Where would you like to go on your mini- vacation?"
"3504" "Katara" "   How about the Misty Palms Oasis?  That sounds refreshing."
"3505" "Aang" "  Oh yeah, I've been there.  It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine.  It's one of nature's wonders."
"3506" "Aang" "  Must have changed ownership since I was here."
"3507" "Sokka" "  I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy."
"3508" "Sokka" "   Excuse me!"
"3509" "Aang" "   No worries, I clean up easy."
"3510" "Aang" "  Thanks.  I try."
"3511" "Aang" "  The southern temple."
"3512" "Aang" "   Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?"
"3513" "Sokka" "  So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy.  Do you have a more current map?  Ours seems to be a little dated."
"3514" "Sokka" "  What, no Fire Nation?   Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?"
"3515" "Katara" "   You've made a lot of trips into the desert."
"3516" "Toph" "  You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?"
"3517" "Toph" "   Mm, sounds like good times."
"3518" "Sokka" "  Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?"
"3519" "Katara" "   I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka."
"3520" "Sokka" "  If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation?  A map maybe?"
"3521" "Sokka" "  Then it's settled.   Aang, I do believe it's my turn.  I'd like to spend my vacation  AT THE LIBRARY!"
"3522" "Toph" "   Uh, hey?  What about me?  When do I get to pick?"
"3523" "Sokka" "   You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time."
"3524" "Sokka" "  Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?"
"3525" "Aang" "  Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here."
"3526" "Toph" "   Aw, does this place even exist?"
"3527" "Toph" "  Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?"
"3528" "Toph" "   There it is!"
"3529" "Toph" "  That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it."
"3530" "Katara" "  It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air."
"3531" "Sokka" "  Down there.  What's that?"
"3532" "Katara" "   Forget it.  It's obviously not what we're looking for.  The building in this drawing is enormous."
"3533" "Sokka" "  What kind of animal is that?"
"3534" "Sokka" "  No, this is the library.   Look!"
"3535" "Sokka" "   It's completely buried."
"3536" "Toph" "   Actually,  that won't be necessary.  The inside seems to be completely intact, and it's huge."
"3537" "Sokka" "  That fox thingy went in through a window.  I say we climb up there and give it a look."
"3538" "Toph" "  I say you guys go ahead without me."
"3539" "Katara" "  You got something against libraries?"
"3540" "Toph" "  I've held books before, and I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me."
"3541" "Katara" "  Oh, right.  Sorry."
"3542" "Toph" "  Let me know if they have something you can listen to."
"3543" "Aang" "   Don't worry buddy.  I'm not making you go underground ever again.  You can stay out here with Toph."
"3544" "Toph" "  What's up?"
"3545" "Aang" "  Nothing.  We just like architecture."
"3546" "Sokka" "  Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?"
"3547" "Aang" "  What do you have against humans?"
"3548" "Sokka" "   What?  Oh, no, no, no destroying, we're not into that."
"3549" "Sokka" "   Um, knowledge, for, knowledge's sake."
"3550" "Sokka" "  I'm not lying.  I'm here with the Avatar,  and he's the bridge between our worlds, he'll vouch for me."
"3551" "Aang" "  Ow.   Uh, yeah, I'll vouch.  We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.   You have my word."
"3552" "Katara" "  I have an authentic waterbending scroll."
"3553" "Aang" "  Uh, oh, I know!   Ha!"
"3554" "Sokka" "  Oh, great spirit,  check this out!   Ta da!"
"3555" "Sokka" "  It's a special knot!  That counts as knowledge."
"3556" "Sokka" "  Bright enough to fool you."
"3557" "Toph" "  So, you like flyin'?"
"3558" "Toph" "  Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see.  Well, I don't see the way you do.  I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet,  but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy."
"3559" "Toph" "  Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy."
"3560" "Aang" "  Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things."
"3561" "Sokka" "  Eh, I've seen weirder."
"3562" "Katara" "  Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left handed?"
"3563" "Aang" "  I always knew I was special."
"3564" "Sokka" "   The darkest day in Fire Nation history.  It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else."
"3565" "Aang" "  Sokka, where are you going?"
"3566" "Sokka" "  I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day.  This could be promising.   The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here."
"3567" "Aang" "  Firebender."
"3568" "Katara" "  They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation."
"3569" "Sokka" "   That's so unfair!   Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago."
"3570" "Sokka" "  I need to know what happened on the darkest day."
"3571" "Sokka" "  Hello, little weird fox guy."
"3572" "Sokka" "  Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you."
"3573" "Sokka" "  Uh, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful?"
"3574" "Katara" "  Maybe these dials represent dates and times.   Sokka, try entering that date from the parchment you took."
"3575" "Sokka" "  Shh!  Katara!   Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl."
"3576" "Aang" "  Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka.  You picked the best mini- vacation, for sure."
"3577" "Katara" "  Hey wait, what happened to the sun?"
"3578" "Aang" "  Great, you must have broken it."
"3579" "Sokka" "  It's not broken."
"3580" "Sokka" "   The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse!  It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history.  Now I get it!   Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why."
"3581" "Sokka" "  Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse!   Sorry."
"3582" "Katara" "  That makes sense.   I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders.  This is huge."
"3583" "Sokka" "  Fine, you earned it."
"3584" "Sokka" "  We've got to get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.  We'll wait for the next eclipse,  then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless.  The Fire Lord is goin' down!"
"3585" "Sokka" "  You don't understand.   If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation.  You saw what they did to your library.  They're destructive and dangerous.  We need this information."
"3586" "Aang" "   We had no choice.  Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love."
"3587" "Aang" "  What are you doing?"
"3588" "Katara" "  He's sinking the building!  We've gotta get out of here!"
"3589" "Toph" "  I already told you, I don't want to snuggle."
"3590" "Toph" "  The library's sinking.  The library's sinking!"
"3591" "Aang" "  We've gotta get back to the surface."
"3592" "Katara" "   Sokka, let's go!"
"3593" "Sokka" "  But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna happen."
"3594" "Katara" "  Don't be stupid, we'll find out later."
"3595" "Sokka" "  No, we won't.   If we leave this place we'll never get the information.   Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover."
"3596" "Sokka" "   Katara, take Momo and get out of here."
"3597" "Katara" "  But-"
"3598" "Sokka" "  Go!"
"3599" "Katara" "   Hurry, Sokka!"
"3600" "Toph" "  What is it now?"
"3601" "Toph" "  Who's there?"
"3602" "Aang" "  Why are we doing this?"
"3603" "Sokka" "  Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be."
"3604" "Aang" "  You can't possibly check every single date."
"3605" "Sokka" "  I don't have to.   We just have to check every date before Sozin's comet arrives, because after that. . .  Well, try not to think about that."
"3606" "Aang" "  Come on, eclipse!"
"3607" "Sokka" "   That's it, the solar eclipse!   It's just a few months away."
"3608" "Sokka" "  Got it.   Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se."
"3609" "Toph" "  Don't make me put this down."
"3610" "Toph" "  No, stop sinking!"
"3611" "Toph" "  No!   I'm sorry Appa."
"3612" "Sokka" "  That's called Sokka style.   Learn it!"
"3613" "Sokka" "  Wait!   Professor, let's go!"
"3614" "Katara" "  Just go!"
"3615" "Sokka" "  We got it.  There's a solar eclipse coming.   The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!"
"3616" "Aang" "  Where's Appa?"
"3617" "Aang" "   How could you let them take Appa  Why didn't you stop them? !"
"3618" "Toph" "  I couldn't!  The library was sinking!  You guys were still inside and -"
"3619" "Aang" "  You could have come to get us!  I could have saved him!"
"3620" "Toph" "  I can hardly feel any vibrations out here.  The sandbenders snuck upon me and there wasn't time for -"
"3621" "Aang" "  You just didn't care!  You never liked Appa!  You wanted him gone!"
"3622" "Katara" "  Aang, stop it.  You know Toph did all she could.  She saved our lives."
"3623" "Sokka" "  Who's going to save our lives now?  We'll never make it out of here."
"3624" "Aang" ""
"3625" "Katara" "  We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now."
"3626" "Aang" "  I'm going after Appa."
"3627" "Katara" "  Aang, wait!"
"3628" "Katara" "  We'd better start walking.  We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse.  We have to get that information to Ba- Sing- Se."
"3629" "Sokka" "  You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?"
"3630" "Zuko" "  Maybe we should make camp."
"3631" "Iroh" "   No, please, don't stop for me!"
"3632" "Iroh" "   What now?"
"3633" "Iroh" "  Colonel Mongke!  What a pleasant surprise!"
"3634" "Zuko" "  You know these guys?"
"3635" "Iroh" "  Sure.  Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary.  Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.   They are also a very capable singing group."
"3636" "Iroh" "  Would you like some tea first?  I'd love some.  How about you, Kachi?   I make you as a jasmine man.  Am I right?"
"3637" "Iroh" "   It's nice to see old friends."
"3638" "Zuko" "  Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you."
"3639" "Iroh" "  Hmm. . .  Old friends that don't want to attack me. . ."
"3640" "Sokka" "   Can't you watch where you're -"
"3641" "Toph" "  No."
"3642" "Sokka" "  Right.  Sorry."
"3643" "Katara" "  Come on guys, we've got to stick together."
"3644" "Sokka" "  If I sweat any more, I don't think sticking together will be a problem."
"3645" "Toph" "  Katara, can I have some water?"
"3646" "Katara" "  Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it."
"3647" "Sokka" "  We're drinking your bending water?  You used this on the swamp guy!"
"3648" "Toph" "  It does taste swampy."
"3649" "Katara" "  I'm sorry, it's all we have."
"3650" "Sokka" "  Not anymore!  Look!"
"3651" "Katara" "  Sokka, wait!  You shouldn't be eating strange plants!"
"3652" "Sokka" "  There's water trapped inside these!"
"3653" "Katara" "  I don't know. . ."
"3654" "Sokka" "  Suit yourself.  It's very thirst- quenching, though."
"3655" "Sokka" "   Drink cactus juice.  It'll quench ya!  Nothing's quenchier.   It's the quenchiest!"
"3656" "Katara" "  Okay, I think you've had enough."
"3657" "Sokka" "  Who lit Toph on fire?"
"3658" "Toph" "  Can I get some of that cactus?"
"3659" "Katara" "  I don't think that's a good idea.  Come on, we need to find Aang."
"3660" "Sokka" "  How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?"
"3661" "Katara" "  Uhhh. . ."
"3662" "Aang" "   Appa!  Appa!  No. . .  NO!"
"3663" "Katara" "  What is that?"
"3664" "Toph" "  What?  What is what?"
"3665" "Sokka" "  It's a giant mushroom!  Maybe it's friendly!"
"3666" "Katara" "  Let's just keep moving.  I hope Aang's okay. . ."
"3667" "Sokka" "   Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!"
"3668" "Katara" "  I'm sorry, Aang.  I know it's hard for you right now, but we need to focus on getting out of here."
"3669" "Aang" "   What's the difference?  We won't survive without Appa.  We all know it."
"3670" "Katara" "  Come on, Aang!  We can do this if we work together.  Right, Toph?"
"3671" "Toph" "  As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding.  I got nothin'."
"3672" "Katara" "  Sokka?   Any ideas how to find Ba- Sing- Se?"
"3673" "Sokka" "  Why don't we ask the circle birds?"
"3674" "Katara" "  Ugh. . .  We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together!  Aang, get up.  Everybody hold hands.  We can do this.  We have to."
"3675" "Katara" "  I think we should stop for the night."
"3676" "Toph" "  Is there any more water?"
"3677" "Katara" "  This is the last of it.  Everyone can have a little drink."
"3678" "Sokka" "  Momo, no!  You've killed us all!"
"3679" "Katara" "  No, he hasn't."
"3680" "Sokka" "  Oh, right.  Bending."
"3681" "Katara" "  Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library."
"3682" "Sokka" "   What!  I didn't steal anything!  Who told you that? !   It was you!  You ratted me out!"
"3683" "Katara" "  Sokka, I was there."
"3684" "Aang" "  It doesn't matter.  None of those will tell us where Appa is."
"3685" "Katara" "  No, but we can find out which way Ba- Sing- Se is.  We can use the stars to guide us.  That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.   Just try to get some sleep.  We'll start again in a few hours."
"3686" "Zuko" "  No one here is going to help us.  These people just look like filthy wanderers."
"3687" "Iroh" "  So do we.   Ah, this is interesting.  I think I've found our friend."
"3688" "Zuko" "  You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?"
"3689" "Iroh" ""
"3690" "Iroh" "  May I have this game?"
"3691" "Iroh" "  Those who do can always find a friend."
"3692" "Zuko" "  What are you old gasbags talking about?"
"3693" "Iroh" "  I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game."
"3694" "Zuko" "  I thought you said he would help!"
"3695" "Iroh" "  He is.  Just watch."
"3696" "Katara" "  Come on, get up.  We need to go."
"3697" "Toph" "  Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud.  Now it just tastes like sand.  I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much."
"3698" "Aang" "  I'm awake.  I couldn't sleep."
"3699" "Katara" "  Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit."
"3700" "Aang" "   Appa!"
"3701" "Sokka" "  Appa?  But why would Princess Yue need him?  She's the moon!  She flies by herself!"
"3702" "Katara" "   It's just a cloud.  Wait!  A cloud!"
"3703" "Katara" "  Wow. . .  there's hardly any in here."
"3704" "Aang" "   I'm sorry, okay!  It's a desert cloud; I did all I could!  What's anyone else doing!  What are you doing?"
"3705" "Katara" "  Trying to keep everyone together.  Let's just get moving.  We need to head in this direction."
"3706" "Toph" "  Ow!  Crud!  I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going!  And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert? !"
"3707" "Katara" "  A boat?"
"3708" "Toph" "  Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations."
"3709" "Katara" "  It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use!  And look!  It's got some kind of compass on it!  I bet it can point us out of here!  Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it.  We're going to make it!"
"3710" "Zuko" "  Now that you played Pai Sho,are you going to do some flower arranging, or is this club going to offer some real help?"
"3711" "Iroh" "  You must forgive my nephew.  He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts."
"3712" "Iroh" "  One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries."
"3713" "Iroh" "  I'm afraid it's members only.  Wait out here. Cut to Aang and company.  Fade to a shot from above of the sand glider racing through the desert.  Aang is driving it forwards by bending powerful gusts of air into the sail.  Katara is standing on the upper platform and navigating using the compass and star map."
"3714" "Sokka" "   Take it easy little lady.  I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here."
"3715" "Katara" "   That's what the compass is pointing to!  That giant rock!  It must be the magnetic center of the desert."
"3716" "Toph" "   A rock?   Yes!  Let's go!"
"3717" "Katara" "  Maybe we can find some water there!"
"3718" "Aang" "   Maybe we can find some sandbenders."
"3719" "Toph" "  Ahhh. . .  Finally!  Solid ground!"
"3720" "Sokka" "   I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice.  And look!"
"3721" "Sokka" "  This tastes like rotten penguin meat!  Awww I feel woozy."
"3722" "Katara" "   You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave? !"
"3723" "Sokka" "  I have a natural curiosity."
"3724" "Toph" "  I don't think this is a normal cave.  This was carved by something."
"3725" "Aang" "  Yeah. . .  look at the shape."
"3726" "Toph" "  There's something buzzing in here.  Something that's coming for us!"
"3727" "Toph" "  Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!"
"3728" "Sokka" "  I got this one."
"3729" "Katara" "  Sokka, there's nothing there."
"3730" "Sokka" "  I guess my head's not as clear as I thought."
"3731" "Katara" "  We have to get out of here!  I'm completely out of water to bend!"
"3732" "Aang" "  Momo!  I'm not losing anyone else out here."
"3733" "Katara" "  Come on, we're going down."
"3734" "Katara" " Toph, shoot a rock right there.  Fire!"
"3735" "Sokka" "  Yeah!  You got it!  She got it, right?"
"3736" "Katara" "  Yes.  Now let's move."
"3737" "Katara" "  On your left!"
"3738" "Zuko" "  What's going on?  Is the club meeting over?"
"3739" "Iroh" "  Everything is taken care of.  We're heading to Ba- Sing- Se."
"3740" "Zuko" "  Ba- Sing- Se?  Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital?"
"3741" "Iroh" "  We can hide in plain sight there.  And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation.  Even I couldn't break through to the city."
"3742" "Katara" "  We found the sailer abandoned in the desert.  We're traveling with the Avatar.  Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba- Sing- Se."
"3743" "Toph" "  I recognize the son's voice.  He's the one that stole Appa."
"3744" "Katara" "  Are you sure?"
"3745" "Toph" "  I never forget a voice."
"3746" "Aang" "   You stole Appa!"
"3747" "Aang" "  Where is my bison? !"
"3748" "Aang" "  You tell me where he is now! Sha-"
"3749" "Toph" "  You said to put a muzzle on him!"
"3750" "Aang" "   You muzzled Appa? !"
"3751" "Aang" "   Tell me where Appa is!"
"3752" "Sokka" "  Just get out of here!  Run!"
"3753" "Katara" "  Waterbending bomb!  Yeah!"
"3754" "Sokka" "   Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit library, just splash some water on 'em."
"3755" "Katara" "  Sorry.  Okay.  We just got out of the desert, so we must be around here, and we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.  It looks like the only passage connecting the South to the North is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass."
"3756" "Toph" "  You're sure that's the best way to go?"
"3757" "Sokka" "  It's the only way, I mean it's not like we have Appa to fly us there."
"3758" "Katara" "   Shush up about Appa.  Can't you at least try to be sensitive?"
"3759" "Aang" "   Katara, it's ok.  I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se, and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse."
"3760" "Katara" "   Oh, well, ok.  I'm glad you're doing better."
"3761" "Sokka" "   Then to Ba Sing Se we go, no more distractions."
"3762" "Aang" "  So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?"
"3763" "Katara" "  Great, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together."
"3764" "Toph" "  Deadly route.   Great pick, Sokka."
"3765" "Sokka" "  Well, we are desperate."
"3766" "Katara" "   Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride. . . or deadly pass?"
"3767" "Katara" "  I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation."
"3768" "Iroh" "   Who would have thought, after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace. . ."
"3769" "Zuko" "   Hello."
"3770" "Iroh" "  What sort of king is he eating like?"
"3771" "Zuko" "   I'm in."
"3772" "Aang" "   Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please."
"3773" "Aang" "  Uh, no one told us we had to have passports."
"3774" "Sokka" "   Don't you know who this is?  He's the Avatar!"
"3775" "Aang" "   That won't be necessary."
"3776" "Toph" "   I'll take care of this.  My name is Toph Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets."
"3777" "Toph" "   It is your pleasure.  As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets."
"3778" "Toph" "  Is my Seeing- Eye Lemur."
"3779" "Toph" "  Thank you very much."
"3780" "Sokka" "   Alright, we scammed that lady good!"
"3781" "Sokka" "   Is there a problem?"
"3782" "Sokka" "   Do I know you?"
"3783" "Sokka" "  Suki! !"
"3784" "Katara" "  You look so different without your makeup, and the new outfit."
"3785" "Sokka" "  I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then, nothing major."
"3786" "Aang" "  Are the other Kyoshi warriors around?"
"3787" "Katara" "   Appa is missing.  We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se."
"3788" "Aang" "   I'm doing fine.  Would everybody stop worrying about me!"
"3789" "Aang" "   I'll talk to the lady for you."
"3790" "Aang" "   But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen.  You have to make an exception."
"3791" "Aang" "  What if we gave them our tickets?"
"3792" "Aang" "  But. . ."
"3793" "Aang" "   Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely.  I'll lead you through the serpents pass."
"3794" "Sokka" "  I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass."
"3795" "Toph" "  I can't believe you're still complaining about it."
"3796" "Sokka" "   Are you sure that's a good idea?"
"3797" "Sokka" "  I do, it's just. . ."
"3798" "Sokka" "  Nothing.  I'm glad you're coming."
"3799" "Sokka" "   This is the Serpent's Pass I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent.  Hmm, I guess they misnamed it."
"3800" "Toph" "  What does it say?"
"3801" "Katara" "   It says, Abandon hope."
"3802" "Aang" "   I don't know.  The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction.  So maybe we do need to abandon it."
"3803" "Katara" "   What are you talking about?"
"3804" "Aang" "  Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa.  We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass."
"3805" "Katara" "   Ok, if you say so."
"3806" "Sokka" "   They've spotted us!  Let's go, let's go!"
"3807" "Sokka" "  Suki, are you ok You have to be more careful!   C'mon!"
"3808" "Toph" "   Thanks for saving my life Toph.  Hey no problem Sokka."
"3809" "Sokka" "  Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.   Who knows how stable this ledge is?  It could give way at any moment."
"3810" "Sokka" "   You're right, you're right.  You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself. . . Wait!   Oh, never mind.  I thought I saw a spider, but you're fine."
"3811" "Katara" "  You know, it's o. k.  to miss Appa.  What's going on with you?  In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa, and now it's like you don't care about him at all."
"3812" "Aang" "  You saw what I did out there.  I was so angry about losing Appa, I couldn't control myself.  I hated feeling like that."
"3813" "Katara" "  But now you're not letting yourself feel anything.  I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care.  But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.  C'mon, you need ahug."
"3814" "Aang" "  Thank you for your concern Katara."
"3815" "Sokka" "  Yeah, it really is."
"3816" "Sokka" "  I know you can."
"3817" "Sokka" "  It's so hard to lose someone you care about.   Something happened at the North Pole, and I couldn't protect someone.  I don't want anything like that to ever happen again."
"3818" "Sokka" "   Who is this guy?  Is he taller than me?"
"3819" "Sokka" "  Is he better looking?"
"3820" "Sokka" "  Oh. . ."
"3821" "Sokka" "  I can't."
"3822" "Sokka" "   No, you shouldn't be."
"3823" "Iroh" "  So, Smellerbee, that's an unusual name for a young man."
"3824" "Iroh" "   Oh, now I see!  It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!"
"3825" "Iroh" "  It is a magnificent sight."
"3826" "Iroh" "  Once, when I was a different man."
"3827" "Iroh" "  That's very noble of you.  I believe people can change their lives if they want to.  I believe in second chances."
"3828" "Katara" "  Everyone single file."
"3829" "Katara" "  Aang, I need help."
"3830" "Katara" "  What is that thing?"
"3831" "Sokka" "   I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass."
"3832" "Sokka" "   Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering.  Thank you."
"3833" "Katara" "    Sokka!"
"3834" "Aang" "  I'll distract him.  Katara, get everyone across."
"3835" "Sokka" "   Toph, come on.  It's just ice."
"3836" "Toph" "   Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see.    Ok, I'm coming!"
"3837" "Sokka" "   You're doing great!  Just follow the sound of my voice!"
"3838" "Toph" "   It's hard to ignore."
"3839" "Sokka" "  You're almost there."
"3840" "Toph" "   Help!  I can't swim!"
"3841" "Sokka" "  I'm coming Toph!"
"3842" "Toph" "   Oh Sokka, you saved me."
"3843" "Toph" "   Oh. . . well. . . heheh.   You can go ahead and let me drown now."
"3844" "Sokka" "   There's the wall!   Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se."
"3845" "Sokka" "   What's wrong?"
"3846" "Katara" "  Sokka, Calm down.  I helped Gran- Gran deliver lots of babies back home."
"3847" "Sokka" "   This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal!  This is a real. . .  human. . . .  thing!"
"3848" "Katara" "  It's called a baby, and I helped todeliver plenty of those too.   Aang, get some rags.  Sokka, water.  Toph, I need you to make an earth tent.  A big one.   Suki, come with me."
"3849" "Zuko" "   I've realized lately, that being on your own isn't always the best path."
"3850" "Katara" "  You're doing great Ying.   Sokka!  Where's that water?  Get ready to push.   One, two, three. . . PUSH!"
"3851" "Katara" "   It's a girl!"
"3852" "Toph" "    So, you want to go see the baby?  Or are you going to  faint like an old lady again?"
"3853" "Sokka" "  No no, I'm good this time."
"3854" "Katara" "  Aang, you have to come see this."
"3855" "Toph" "  She sounds healthy."
"3856" "Katara" "   She's beautiful."
"3857" "Sokka" "   It's so. . . squishy looking."
"3858" "Aang" "   I've been going through a really hard time lately.  But you've made me. . .  hopeful again."
"3859" "Aang" "   I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings.  Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it reminded me of how I feel about Appa. . . . . and how I feel about you."
"3860" "Aang" "  I promise I'll find Appa as fast as I can.  I just really need to do this."
"3861" "Sokka" "  See ya in the big city."
"3862" "Toph" "  Say hi to that big fuzzball for me."
"3863" "Katara" "    You'll find him Aang."
"3864" "Aang" "   I know.  Thank you Katara."
"3865" "Aang" "   You ready Momo?"
"3866" "Sokka" "   Whoa, hold on.  Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?"
"3867" "Sokka" "   So you came along to protect me?"
"3868" "Sokka" "   You talk too much."
"3869" "Aang" "   Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.  "
"3870" "Katara" "  Aang, what are you doing here?  I thought you were looking for Appa?"
"3871" "Aang" "  I was, but something stopped me.  Something big."
"3872" "Sokka" "   Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?"
"3873" "Aang" "  That."
"3874" "Aang" "   I'm the Avatar.  Take me to whoever's in charge."
"3875" "Aang" "  Not needed?"
"3876" "Toph" "  What about the Dragon of the West?  He got in."
"3877" "Toph" "  Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem."
"3878" "Sokka" "   That's a good group name, very catchy."
"3879" "Sokka" "   Get a hold of yourself man!"
"3880" "Toph" "  Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now?"
"3881" "Aang" "  The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing?"
"3882" "Sokka" "  Why are you all looking at me?"
"3883" "Aang" "  You're the idea guy."
"3884" "Sokka" "   So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan?  That's a lot of pressure."
"3885" "Katara" "  And also the complaining guy."
"3886" "Sokka" "  That part I don't mind."
"3887" "Iroh" "  It's pronounced Moo- shee."
"3888" "Iroh" "   Uh, no no no.   But may I just say that you're like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating."
"3889" "Zuko" "   I'm gonna forget I saw that."
"3890" "Katara" "  His Chi is blocked.   Who did this to you?"
"3891" "Katara" "   Ty Lee.  She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points.  It's like she takes you down from the inside."
"3892" "Sokka" "   What you just said, that's how we're gonna take down the Drill.  The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders."
"3893" "Toph" "   By hitting its pressure points!"
"3894" "Aang" "   We'll take it down from the inside."
"3895" "Toph" "   Once I whip up some cover, you're not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me."
"3896" "Toph" "  Run!"
"3897" "Toph" "  Everyone into the hole!"
"3898" "Sokka" "  It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing."
"3899" "Toph" "   Oh no, what a nightmare."
"3900" "Sokka" "  Sorry."
"3901" "Sokka" "   There!"
"3902" "Sokka" "   Toph, Come on!"
"3903" "Toph" "   No way am I going in that metal monster.  I can't bend in there.  I'll try to slow it down out here."
"3904" "Sokka" "  Okay, good luck.   I need a plan of this machine.  Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.  Then we can find it's weak points."
"3905" "Aang" "  Where are we gonna get something like that  What are you doing!  Someone's gonna hear us!"
"3906" "Sokka" "   That's the point.  I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it, and when something breaks. . ."
"3907" "Katara" "  They come to fix it."
"3908" "Katara" "   Hi."
"3909" "Sokka" "   This'll work, thanks!"
"3910" "Sokka" "   It looks like the Drill is made up of two main structures.  There's the inner mechanism, where we are now, and the outer shell.   The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces.  If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse."
"3911" "Iroh" "   Oh!  Jasmine, please.   Blaugh!  Ugh.  Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it.  What a disgrace!"
"3912" "Zuko" "  Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang."
"3913" "Zuko" "   I said no."
"3914" "Iroh" "   Hey!"
"3915" "Zuko" "   What are you doing firebending your tea? !  For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move."
"3916" "Iroh" "   I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but. . .    that's so sad."
"3917" "Sokka" "   Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans.  We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that."
"3918" "Katara" "   What's this we stuff?  Aang and I are going to have to do all the work."
"3919" "Sokka" "   Look, I'm the plan guy, You two  are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys.   Together, we're Team Avatar!"
"3920" "Sokka" "   C'mon team, don't quit now, we're. . ."
"3921" "Katara" "   Grrrrrr!"
"3922" "Sokka" "  I mean,  you're almost there."
"3923" "Katara" "   At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall."
"3924" "Aang" "   I don't know how many more of those I have in me."
"3925" "Sokka" "  Do you hear that We took it down.  We better get out of here fast!"
"3926" "Katara" "  This is bad, really bad."
"3927" "Sokka" "  Were putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!"
"3928" "Aang" "   Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through.  Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.   Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've gotta be quick and accurate.   Hit a series of points, and break your opponent's stance.  And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.   His own weight becomes his downfall.  Literally."
"3929" "Katara" "  So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cut all the way through."
"3930" "Aang" "   Then I'll go to the top of this thing, and deliver the final blow."
"3931" "Sokka" "   And boom, it all comes crashing down!"
"3932" "Aang" "   Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us."
"3933" "Sokka" "  The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is."
"3934" "Toph" "   C'mon twinkle toes, hurry up!"
"3935" "Aang" "  That's enough, we need to get to the next one!"
"3936" "Sokka" "   Good work Team Avatar.  Now Aang just needs to. . .   DUCK!"
"3937" "Aang" "   Whoa!"
"3938" "Sokka" "   Hey."
"3939" "Aang" "  Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do."
"3940" "Katara" "  Wait!  You need this water more than I do!"
"3941" "Katara" "   Slurry pipeline What does that mean?"
"3942" "Sokka" "   It's rock and water mixed together, it means our way out."
"3943" "Katara" "   Why don't you try blocking my chi now circus freak!"
"3944" "Sokka" "  Katara, keep that up.  The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!"
"3945" "Aang" "   This looks like a good spot Momo.   Aggh!"
"3946" "Aang" "   General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!"
"3947" "Sokka" "   Good technique little sister!  Keep it up!  Don't forget to breathe!"
"3948" "Katara" "   You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day.  You're like a chattering Hog- Monkey!"
"3949" "Sokka" "   Just bend the slurry woman! !"
"3950" "Toph" "   You guys need some help?"
"3951" "Katara" "  Toph, help me plug up this drain!"
"3952" "Aang" "   What I'd give to be a metal bender."
"3953" "Aang" "  Momo, get out of here!"
"3954" "Aang" "   Thanks Momo, I owe you one."
"3955" "Aang" "  Now all I need is a. . .   Actually, that is what I needed for once."
"3956" "Toph" "  Here it comes!"
"3957" "Iroh" "  What a handsome baby."
"3958" "Sokka" "   I just want to say, good effort out there today Team Avatar."
"3959" "Katara" "   Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.  No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on."
"3960" "Sokka" "  How about. . .   the Boomerang Squad! , see it's good cause it's got Aang in it."
"3961" "Sokka" "  The Aang Gang?"
"3962" "Katara" "  Sokka."
"3963" "Sokka" "  The Fearsome Foursome?"
"3964" "Toph" "  You're crazy."
"3965" "Sokka" "   Why?  We're fearsome!  "
"3966" "Katara" "  Look, the inner wall.  I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece."
"3967" "Sokka" "  Hey don't jinx it!  We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon.  Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp."
"3968" "Toph" "  You been hitting the cactus juice again?"
"3969" "Sokka" "  I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us."
"3970" "Katara" "  Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa."
"3971" "Aang" "  It's such a big city."
"3972" "Sokka" "  He's a giant bison.  Where could someone possibly hide him?  Oh."
"3973" "Toph" "   Back in the city.  Great."
"3974" "Sokka" "  What's the problem?  It's amazing!"
"3975" "Toph" "  Just a bunch of walls and rules.  You wait; you'll get sick of it in a couple of days."
"3976" "Aang" "  I'm comin' for you buddy.  He's here.  I can feel it."
"3977" "Sokka" "  Yes.  We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately."
"3978" "Sokka" "  Augh!  Maybe you missed what I said.  We need to talk to the King about the war, it's important."
"3979" "Katara" "  What's that wall for?"
"3980" "Katara" "  Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?"
"3981" "Aang" "  This is why I never came here before.  I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live."
"3982" "Iroh" "  I just want our new place to look nice in case someone brings home a lady friend."
"3983" "Zuko" "  This city is a prison.  I don't want to make a life here."
"3984" "Iroh" "  Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.  Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon."
"3985" "Sokka" "  Yeah, we met a Professor from Ba Sing Se University.  He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is absolutely crucial for the King to hear!"
"3986" "Sokka" "  Is that woman deaf She only seems to hear every other word I say."
"3987" "Toph" "  It's called being handled.  Get used to it."
"3988" "Zuko" "  Ridiculous."
"3989" "Iroh" "  Uh, Does this possibly come in a larger size?"
"3990" "Iroh" "  Eeow!  This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!"
"3991" "Zuko" "  Uncle, that's what all tea is."
"3992" "Iroh" "  How can a member of my own family say something so horrible?  We'll have to make some major changes around here."
"3993" "Katara" "  What's inside that wall?"
"3994" "Sokka" "  And who are the mean looking guys in robes?"
"3995" "Aang" "  Can we see the King now?"
"3996" "Sokka" "   A month!"
"3997" "Sokka" "  I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long.  Can't we see the King any sooner?"
"3998" "Aang" "  If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa."
"3999" "Toph" "  We don't need a babysitter."
"4000" "Aang" "  If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go?"
"4001" "Sokka" "  Where's the black market?  Who runs it?  Come on, you know!"
"4002" "Sokka" "  Right.  And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?"
"4003" "Sokka" "   Hey, come with me."
"4004" "Sokka" "  So Pao, what's goin' on with this city?  Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war?"
"4005" "Toph" "  I can feel you shaking."
"4006" "Katara" "  Get in trouble with who?"
"4007" "Iroh" "  Would you like a pot of tea?"
"4008" "Zuko" "  We've been working in a tea shop all day.  I'm sick of tea!"
"4009" "Iroh" "  Sick of tea?  That's like being sick of breathing!   Have you seen our spark rocks to heat up the water?"
"4010" "Iroh" "  I borrowed our neighbors, such kind people."
"4011" "Katara" "  I've got it!  I know how we're gonna see the Earth King!"
"4012" "Toph" "  How are we supposed to do that?  One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King ."
"4013" "Katara" "  The King is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear."
"4014" "Aang" "  You mean Platypus- Bear?"
"4015" "Katara" "   No, it just says Bear."
"4016" "Sokka" "  Certainly you mean his pet Skunk- Bear."
"4017" "Toph" "  Or his Armadillo- Bear."
"4018" "Aang" "  Gopher- Bear?"
"4019" "Katara" "  Just. . . Bear."
"4020" "Toph" "  This place is weird."
"4021" "Katara" "  The palace will be packed.  We can sneak in with the crowd."
"4022" "Toph" "   Won't work."
"4023" "Katara" "  Why not?"
"4024" "Toph" "  Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd would spot you from a mile away.  You've got no manners."
"4025" "Katara" "    Excuse me?  I've got no manners?  You're not exactly lady fancy fingers."
"4026" "Toph" "  I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it.   You never learned anything.  And frankly, it's a little too late."
"4027" "Sokka" "  Ah- Ha, but you learned it.  You could teach us."
"4028" "Aang" "  Yeah, I'm mastering every element.  How hard could manners be  Good evening, Mr.  Sokka Watertribe.  Ms.  Katara Watertribe.  Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty, your Momo- ness."
"4029" "Sokka" "    Avatar Aang, how you do?  Go on."
"4030" "Aang" "  Ow!"
"4031" "Toph" "  Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys."
"4032" "Sokka" "  But I feel so fancy."
"4033" "Aang" "  Earth!"
"4034" "Sokka" "  Fire!  Augh!  Ooh!"
"4035" "Aang" "  Wow, you look beautiful."
"4036" "Toph" "  Don't talk to the commoners, Katara.  First rule of society."
"4037" "Katara" "  We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate."
"4038" "Iroh" "  The secret ingredient is love."
"4039" "Zuko" "  You want a show?  I'll give you a show."
"4040" "Toph" "  I think this will do."
"4041" "Toph" "   Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us.  I'm going to have to tell them who didn't let me in."
"4042" "Katara" "  Sir I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.   She's blind.  Do you think you could help us?  Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried."
"4043" "Katara" "  I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung.   Ow!"
"4044" "Katara" "  Um. . .  I don't see 'em right now.  But I'm sure we'll find them soon.  Thanks for all your help."
"4045" "Aang" "  Where are they?"
"4046" "Sokka" "  Look, I came up with a backup plan.   He flies by the guards creating a distraction, then we blast a hole in the wall. . ."
"4047" "Aang" "  Or, we could go in with these guys.  Toph said we might pass as busboys."
"4048" "Sokka" "  OK, but remember that Momo ghost plan.  I think it's a winner."
"4049" "Iroh" "  Please son, you're confused.  You don't know what you're doing!"
"4050" "Zuko" "  You're the one who needs help."
"4051" "Aang" "  Where are Toph and Katara?"
"4052" "Sokka" "  Forget about them, just keep an eye out for the King."
"4053" "Aang" "  I don't know what he looks like."
"4054" "Sokka" "  You know, royal, flowing robe, fancy jewelry."
"4055" "Aang" "   That could be anyone."
"4056" "Toph" "  Another crab puff please."
"4057" "Aang" "  You found us."
"4058" "Toph" "  I'd know your little footsteps anywhere Twinkletoes."
"4059" "Sokka" "   Thanks for letting us in."
"4060" "Katara" "  Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight."
"4061" "Sokka" "  What guy?"
"4062" "Sokka" "  Not until we see the King."
"4063" "Aang" "  Sorry!  No, don't shout."
"4064" "Sokka" "  You keep their attention while I look for the King."
"4065" "Aang" "  Watch this everybody!"
"4066" "Iroh" "  This poor boy is confused.  We're just simple refugees."
"4067" "Iroh" "    Oh ho ho.  That's very sweet."
"4068" "Sokka" "  Aang, the Earth King."
"4069" "Aang" "  Greetings your majesty."
"4070" "Sokka" "  Hey, let me go."
"4071" "Katara" "  So the King is just a figurehead."
"4072" "Toph" "   He's your puppet!"
"4073" "Sokka" "  But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.  You could lead an invasion. . ."
"4074" "Katara" "  You can't keep the truth from all these people.  They have to know."
"4075" "Aang" "   I'll tell them.  I'll make sure everyone knows!"
"4076" "Katara" "  What happened to Joo Dee?"
"4077" "Toph" "  I'm ready."
"4078" "Katara" "  You're not gonna wash up?  You've got a little dirt on your. . .  everywhere actually."
"4079" "Toph" "  You call it dirt.  I call it a healthy coating of earth."
"4080" "Katara" "  Hmmm.  You know what we need?  A girl's day out!"
"4081" "Toph" "  Do I have to?"
"4082" "Katara" "  It'll be fun."
"4083" "Toph" "  The Fancy Lady Day Spa?  Sounds like my kinda place."
"4084" "Katara" "  Are you ready for some serious pampering?"
"4085" "Toph" "  Sure Katara, whatever you say.  As long as they don't touch my feet."
"4086" "Toph" "  Arrrr!  Rrrrr!  Errrr!"
"4087" "Toph" "  Well, that wasn't so bad.  I'm not usually into that stuff, but I actually feel. . .  girly."
"4088" "Katara" "   I'm glad, it's about time we did something fun together."
"4089" "Toph" "  Thanks."
"4090" "Katara" "  Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking."
"4091" "Katara" "  Let's go Toph."
"4092" "Toph" "  No, no.  That was a good one!  Like your poodle- monkey. . .  Ha ha!  You know what else is a good one?"
"4093" "Katara" "  Now that was funny."
"4094" "Katara" "  Those girls don't know what they're talking about."
"4095" "Toph" "  It's ok.  One of the good things about being blind is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearances.   I don't care what I look like.  I'm not looking for anyone's approval.  I know who I am."
"4096" "Katara" "  That's what I really admire about you, Toph.  You're so strong and confident and self assured.  And I know it doesn't matter, but. . .  you're really pretty."
"4097" "Toph" "   I am?"
"4098" "Katara" "  Yeah.  You are."
"4099" "Toph" "  I'd return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like."
"4100" "Katara" ""
"4101" "Toph" "  Thank you, Katara."
"4102" "Katara" "  Ow!"
"4103" "Iroh" "  No, it is not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion.   The moonflower likes partial shade."
"4104" "Iroh" "  Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells,Drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home."
"4105" "Iroh" "  Yeowch!"
"4106" "Iroh" "  It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to restore honor-"
"4107" "Iroh" "  - but not this time.  Run!"
"4108" "Iroh" "  What are you doing?"
"4109" "Iroh" "  With that stance?"
"4110" "Iroh" "  With a poor stance you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over. ."
"4111" "Iroh" "  With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.   Much better!  But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type."
"4112" "Iroh" "  Of course!"
"4113" "Iroh" "  While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing."
"4114" "Iroh" "  Happy Birthday my son.   If only I could have helped you.  Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile, tiny shells,Drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home."
"4115" "Aang" "   What kind of animal is that?"
"4116" "Aang" "   Let's do it!"
"4117" "Aang" "  There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city."
"4118" "Aang" "   Don't worry.  I'm great with animals."
"4119" "Aang" "   This was so much easier in my head!"
"4120" "Aang" "  Well, Mr.  Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?"
"4121" "Aang" ""
"4122" "Sokka" "   Ahh, poetry."
"4123" "Sokka" "  I am so sorry.  Something struck me in the rear.  I just. . .  wound up. . .  here?"
"4124" "Sokka" "   They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe,  I am not an oaf. Madame Macmu-"
"4125" "Sokka" "  You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard."
"4126" "Sokka" "  I calls it easy!  Like I paddle my canoe,  I'll paddle yours too!"
"4127" "Sokka" "   Squish- squash, sling that slang.  I'm always right back at ya, like my. . .   boomerang!"
"4128" "Sokka" "   That's right I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an okka, young ladies, I rocked ya!"
"4129" "Sokka" "  . . . poetry."
"4130" "Iroh" "   You're right Zuko.  I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.   Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you."
"4131" "Zuko" "   What? !"
"4132" "Zuko" "   My name's Lee.  My Uncle and I just moved here."
"4133" "Iroh" "   He'd love to!"
"4134" "Zuko" "  It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair."
"4135" "Zuko" "  It's ok."
"4136" "Zuko" "  Nothing."
"4137" "Zuko" "   She is not my girlfriend!"
"4138" "Zuko" "   You have. . .  quite an appetite for a girl."
"4139" "Zuko" "  Um, well, we've been traveling around for a long time."
"4140" "Zuko" "  We were uh, apart of this traveling circus."
"4141" "Zuko" "  Yes.  I juggled."
"4142" "Zuko" "  Whoah!  I haven't practiced for awhile."
"4143" "Zuko" "  Close your eyes and don't peek."
"4144" "Zuko" "  Ok.  Now you can look."
"4145" "Zuko" "  I brought you something.  It's a coupon for a free cup of tea."
"4146" "Zuko" "   Don't thank me.  It was my Uncle's idea.  He thinks you're our most valuable customer."
"4147" "Zuko" "  It's complicated.  I have to go."
"4148" "Iroh" "  How was your night, Prince Zuko?"
"4149" "Zuko" "  It was nice."
"4150" "Toph" "  Don't make me put this down!"
"4151" "Toph" "  I'm sorry Appa."
"4152" "Aang" "   Appa!  Appa!"
"4153" "Aang" "    Appa!   No. . .  NOOOO!"
"4154" "Aang" "    Ugh!  I guess this mean we'll always be together."
"4155" "Aang" "   Always."
"4156" "Iroh" "  Huh!"
"4157" "Zuko" "   Uncle?  What are you looking at?  Is there something out there?"
"4158" "Iroh" "   Uh, it's nothing.  Go back to sleep."
"4159" "Katara" "  We found a printer to make our posters."
"4160" "Sokka" "  Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job.  I've been working all day on my Appa."
"4161" "Aang" "   Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head."
"4162" "Sokka" "   This IS his head."
"4163" "Katara" "   Why are feet coming out of it?"
"4164" "Sokka" "   Those are his horns!   I haven't seen him awhile ok? !"
"4165" "Toph" "   It looks just like him to me."
"4166" "Sokka" "   Thank you, I worked really. . .   Why do you feel the need to do that?"
"4167" "Katara" "  Let's just stick with the professional version."
"4168" "Sokka" "  Grrrr!"
"4169" "Aang" "   Come on, let's get busy!"
"4170" "Iroh" "   Good tea is its own reward."
"4171" "Iroh" "   My own tea shop?  This is a dream come true."
"4172" "Iroh" "   I even get to name the shop?"
"4173" "Iroh" "   Did you hear nephew?  This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the upper ring of the city."
"4174" "Zuko" "   I'll try to contain my joy."
"4175" "Aang" "  I just finished dropping all the leaflets.  Has anyone come in with news about Appa?"
"4176" "Katara" "   It's only been a day, just be patient."
"4177" "Aang" "   Wow, you're right!  Patience really pays off.   Joo Dee? !"
"4178" "Sokka" "  What happened to you?  Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?"
"4179" "Toph" "  But you disappeared at the Earth King's party."
"4180" "Katara" "  But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee."
"4181" "Aang" "  Why are you here?"
"4182" "Sokka" "   We can't wait around to get permission for everything."
"4183" "Aang" "   WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES, AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON! !   We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way!"
"4184" "Sokka" "   That might come back to bite us in the blubber."
"4185" "Aang" "   I don't care.  From now on we do whatever it takes to find Appa."
"4186" "Toph" "   YEAH!  Let's break some rules!"
"4187" "Iroh" "  So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop.  How ;bout the Jasmine Dragon?  It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it."
"4188" "Zuko" "  The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.   And he's lost his bison."
"4189" "Iroh" "   We have a chance for a new life here.   If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us."
"4190" "Zuko" "   Good things that are happening for you.  Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?"
"4191" "Iroh" "   There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity.  I suggest you think about what it is that you want for your life, and why."
"4192" "Zuko" "   I want my destiny."
"4193" "Iroh" "  What that means is up to you.   The Tea Weevil!   No, that's stupid."
"4194" "Sokka" "  Well split up to cover more area.  Toph, I guess you should just come with me."
"4195" "Toph" "  Why because you think I can't put up posters on my own?"
"4196" "Toph" "    It's upside- down isn't it?  I'll just go with Sokka."
"4197" "Katara" "  Tell it to some other girl, Jet!"
"4198" "Sokka" "  Katara, what is it?"
"4199" "Katara" "  Jet's back."
"4200" "Katara" "   We can't trust anything Jet says."
"4201" "Sokka" "  But we don't even know why he's here."
"4202" "Katara" "   I don't care why he's here.  Whatever the reason is, it can't be good."
"4203" "Aang" "   Katara, we have to give him a chance."
"4204" "Katara" "   You're lying!"
"4205" "Toph" "  He's not lying."
"4206" "Sokka" "  How can you tell?"
"4207" "Toph" "  I can feel his breathing and heart beat.  When people lie, there is a physical reaction.  He's telling the truth."
"4208" "Aang" "   Katara, we don't have any leads.  If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out."
"4209" "Katara" "   Alright. . .   but we're not letting you out of out sight!"
"4210" "Aang" "  There's nothing here."
"4211" "Katara" "   If this is a trap. . . !"
"4212" "Toph" "   He was here!"
"4213" "Aang" "   We missed him."
"4214" "Aang" "   What island? !  Where's Appa? !"
"4215" "Aang" "   We've gotta get to Whaletail Island.   Where's Whaletail Island?"
"4216" "Sokka" "   Far.  Very far.   Here it is.  It's near the South Pole almost all the way back home."
"4217" "Katara" "  Aang, It'll take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom.  And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island."
"4218" "Aang" "   I don't care.  We have a chance to find Appa.  We have to try."
"4219" "Katara" "   Don't you have some more hair to clean up?"
"4220" "Katara" "  You're right Aang.   Right now, our first concern has to be finding Appa.  We can come back when we have him."
"4221" "Sokka" "   All right, let's get moving."
"4222" "Katara" "   We don't need you help."
"4223" "Katara" "   Gee, I wonder?"
"4224" "Toph" "   Was this guy your boyfriend or something?"
"4225" "Katara" "   What?  No!"
"4226" "Toph" "   I can tell you're lyyyyying."
"4227" "Sokka" "  We can take the train out to the wall, but then we'll have to walk."
"4228" "Aang" "   Don't worry, on the way back, we'll be flying!"
"4229" "Toph" "   We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.   Worst city ever!"
"4230" "Katara" "   I thought you said you didn't have your gang anymore?"
"4231" "Katara" "   The Dai Li? !"
"4232" "Toph" "   This doesn't make any sense.  They're both telling the truth."
"4233" "Katara" "  That's impossible."
"4234" "Sokka" "   No, it's not.  Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth.  Jet's been brainwashed."
"4235" "Katara" "  The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot too."
"4236" "Aang" "   I bet they have Appa here in the city.  Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.   Where did they take you?"
"4237" "Aang" "  We need to find a way to jog his real memories."
"4238" "Sokka" "    Maybe Katara could kiss him.  That should bring something back."
"4239" "Katara" "   Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka."
"4240" "Sokka" "   Hey, just an idea."
"4241" "Aang" "   A bad one."
"4242" "Sokka" "   Oo, wait.  I got it."
"4243" "Toph" "  Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions."
"4244" "Katara" "  Close your eyes.  Picture it."
"4245" "Katara" "  Maybe this will help."
"4246" "Sokka" "  Wait!  Remember what Joo Dee said?   She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai."
"4247" "Toph" "   There's a tunnel right there near the shore."
"4248" "Sokka" "   Now that's something different."
"4249" "Aang" "  Long Feng is escaping!"
"4250" "Aang" "   You do have Appa.  Tell me where he is!"
"4251" "Aang" "   You're definitely not!"
"4252" "Iroh" "   So, the Blue Spirit.  I wonder who could be behind that mask?"
"4253" "Zuko" "   What are you doing here?"
"4254" "Iroh" "  I was just about to ask you the same thing.  What do you plan to do now that you have found the Avatar's bison?  Keep it locked in our new apartment?  Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?"
"4255" "Zuko" "  First I have to get it out of here."
"4256" "Iroh" "  AND THEN WHAT? !  You never think these things through!  This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole!  You had him, and then you had no where to go!"
"4257" "Zuko" "   I would have figured something out!"
"4258" "Iroh" "   No! !  If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!"
"4259" "Zuko" "   I know my own destiny uncle."
"4260" "Iroh" "   Is it your own destiny?  Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?"
"4261" "Zuko" "   Stop it Uncle.  I have to do this."
"4262" "Iroh" "   I'm begging you Prince Zuko!  It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions.  Who are you?  And what do you want?"
"4263" "Aang" "   Jet, it's me Aang!  You don't have to do this."
"4264" "Aang" "  Jet, I'm your friend!  Look inside your heart!"
"4265" "Aang" "  He can't make you do this!  You're a Freedom Fighter."
"4266" "Aang" "   Don't be."
"4267" "Katara" "   This isn't good."
"4268" "Katara" "  We're not going to leave you."
"4269" "Aang" "  Appa's gone.  Long Feng beat us here."
"4270" "Sokka" "  If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up to him."
"4271" "Sokka" "   Do you think we can out run them?"
"4272" "Aang" "  I don't think it's gonna matter."
"4273" "Aang" "  What is it Momo?"
"4274" "Aang" "  Appa!"
"4275" "Sokka" "   Yeah!  Appa!"
"4276" "Aang" "   I missed you, buddy."
"4277" "Iroh" "  You did the right thing, nephew.   Leave it behind."
"4278" "Aang" "   I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy."
"4279" "Sokka" "   Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan.  We're on a roll."
"4280" "Katara" "   One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll."
"4281" "Sokka" "  We can build on it.  If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support."
"4282" "Toph" "  What makes you think we'll get it?  I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang."
"4283" "Sokka" "  I know, but I've got a good feeling about this.  This time will be different."
"4284" "Katara" "   Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city.  His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful.  I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us."
"4285" "Toph" "  I'm with sweetness.  I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se,  and I can't even see!"
"4286" "Aang" "   But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth about the conspiracy and the war."
"4287" "Sokka" "  See, Aang's with me.   It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try."
"4288" "Katara" "   Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change."
"4289" "Toph" "   I don't trust the new positive Sokka.   Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!"
"4290" "Sokka" "  That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.   So?"
"4291" "Katara" "   Let's fly!"
"4292" "Toph" "   Can we please buy a new saddle?  Riding bareback is terrifying!"
"4293" "Sokka" "  There it is.  That whole thing is the palace.  The Earth King's chambers should be in the center."
"4294" "Katara" "  We have to be careful.  Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming."
"4295" "Sokka" "  Why would you assume that?  If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in. . . . Ahhh!"
"4296" "Toph" "   What was that? !"
"4297" "Sokka" "   Surface to air rocks!   More incoming!  Ahhh!"
"4298" "Katara" "  Sorry!"
"4299" "Katara" "  Sorry!  We just need to get through to see the Earth King."
"4300" "Sokka" "  Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side.   Sorry."
"4301" "Sokka" "  In there."
"4302" "Sokka" "  Toph, which way to the Earth King?"
"4303" "Toph" "  How should I know?  I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se."
"4304" "Sokka" "   Sorry, wrong door."
"4305" "Iroh" "  You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free."
"4306" "Zuko" "   I don't feel right."
"4307" "Iroh" "   Zuko!"
"4308" "Sokka" "  Now that's an impressive door.  It's gotta go somewhere."
"4309" "Sokka" "  A little warning next time!"
"4310" "Aang" "   We need to talk to you!"
"4311" "Sokka" "  No, we're on your side.  We're here to help."
"4312" "Katara" "   You have to trust us."
"4313" "Toph" "   He has a good point."
"4314" "Aang" "   See, we're friends, your Earthiness.  The scene reopens to a shot of the elaborate dais, showing the five Dai Li standing ready before Long Feng and the Earth King."
"4315" "Sokka" "   But we dropped our weapons.  We're your allies."
"4316" "Sokka" "  Uh, no, him."
"4317" "Aang" "  Over here."
"4318" "Aang" "   Well, sir, there is a war going on right now.  For the past 100 years, in fact.  The Dai  Li's kept it secret from you.  It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you."
"4319" "Aang" "   Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us.  And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!"
"4320" "Sokka" "  Wait, I can prove he's lying.  Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe."
"4321" "Aang" "  Right there!  Appa bit him."
"4322" "Sokka" "   Never met a Sky Bison , huh?"
"4323" "Sokka" "  Of course there is!"
"4324" "Iroh" "  You're burning up.  You have an intense fever.   This will help cool you down."
"4325" "Zuko" "   So thirsty."
"4326" "Iroh" "  Here's some clean water to drink.   Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out."
"4327" "Katara" "   So you've never been outside the upper ring before?"
"4328" "Sokka" "  Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.  To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.  You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place."
"4329" "Toph" "  It's gone!"
"4330" "Sokka" "   Oh, don't tell me. .   That's ok, still got my positive attitude."
"4331" "Katara" "  The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence."
"4332" "Sokka" "  Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more."
"4333" "Katara" "   The wall!  They'll never be able to cover that up in time!"
"4334" "Aang" "  Oh yeah.   If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real! Earth King   No Earth King has ever been to the outer wall.  I don't have anymore time for this nonsense."
"4335" "Sokka" "   If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa."
"4336" "Toph" "   First time flying?"
"4337" "Toph" "  Yeah, I hate it too."
"4338" "Aang" "   I wish it wasn't."
"4339" "Zuko" "  I'm not tired."
"4340" "Aang" "  It's still there!"
"4341" "Sokka" "  It's a drill.  A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls."
"4342" "Katara" "   Really Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project."
"4343" "Sokka" "   Looks like Long Feng is long gone!  Ha. . . Oh, yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one."
"4344" "Sokka" "   That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness.  Because we think you can help us end the war."
"4345" "Aang" "   We don't have much time.  There's a comet coming this summer.  Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength.  They'll be unstoppable."
"4346" "Sokka" "  But there is hope.  Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity.  A solar eclipse is coming.  The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless."
"4347" "Sokka" "   That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.  The Day of Black Sun."
"4348" "Sokka" "  You're already vulnerable.  The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.  You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance."
"4349" "Aang" "  Secret files?"
"4350" "Katara" "   It's a letter from your mom.  You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you."
"4351" "Toph" "   Long Feng intercepted our letters from home?  That's just sad."
"4352" "Aang" "   It's from the Eastern Air Temple."
"4353" "Katara" "   Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?"
"4354" "Sokka" "   Oh."
"4355" "Katara" "   A small fleet of water tribe ships. . ."
"4356" "Sokka" "   What?  That could be Dad."
"4357" "Katara" "   Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda.  It is Dad!"
"4358" "Iroh" "  You should know this is not a natural sickness.  But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea."
"4359" "Zuko" "   What?  What's happening?"
"4360" "Iroh" "  You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake. . . it was in such conflict with your image of yourself, that you are now at war within your own mind and body."
"4361" "Zuko" ""
"4362" "Aang" "   I can't believe it.  There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple.  He says he's a Guru."
"4363" "Sokka" "  What's a Guru?  Some kind of poisonous blowfish?"
"4364" "Aang" "   No, a spiritual expert.  He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey.  He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State."
"4365" "Katara" "   And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now."
"4366" "Toph" "   I know what you mean.  My Mom's in the city, and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me."
"4367" "Sokka" "  This is all such big news.  Where do we even start?"
"4368" "Katara" "  I hate to say it, but. . . we have to split up."
"4369" "Aang" "   Split up?  We just found Appa and got the family back together.  Now you want us to separate?"
"4370" "Katara" "   You have to meet this Guru, Aang.  If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready."
"4371" "Aang" "   Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple.  Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad."
"4372" "Sokka" "   Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.  I guess that's me?"
"4373" "Katara" "   No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad.  You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king."
"4374" "Sokka" "   You are. . . the nicest. . .  sister. . . ever."
"4375" "Katara" "   Easy there, big brother.   Though you're right, I am."
"4376" "Aang" "   Katara, I need to tell you something.  I've been wanting to say it for a long time."
"4377" "Katara" "   What is it Aang?"
"4378" "Aang" "   Katara, I. . ."
"4379" "Sokka" "   Alright!  Who's ready to get going on our little men-"
"4380" "Sokka" "   That's Suki! !"
"4381" "Sokka" "   Oh yeah.  The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too.  They're good friends of ours."
"4382" "Katara" "   Wait, Aang."
"4383" "Toph" "   I'm really gonna miss you guys."
"4384" "Katara" "  Me too."
"4385" "Aang" "  Yeah."
"4386" "Sokka" "  Ahhh!  Great!  That's enough!  Ok, we love each other.    Seriously."
"4387" "Zuko" "  Ahhhh!"
"4388" "Sokka" "   You see Aang, a little positive thinking works wonders.  We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me."
"4389" "Aang" "   Yeah, girls are waiting for us.  Thanks positive attitude."
"4390" "Sokka" "   Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever."
"4391" "Toph" "  Hello?  Mom?  Anyone home?"
"4392" "Toph" "   Hey!  Who do you think you're dealing with? !"
"4393" "Zuko" "  What's that smell?"
"4394" "Iroh" "   It's jook.  I'm sure you wouldn't like it."
"4395" "Zuko" "   Actually, it smells delicious.  I'd love a bowl, Uncle."
"4396" "Iroh" "   Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow."
"4397" "Zuko" "   It's a new day.  We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop.  Things are looking up Uncle."
"4398" "Aang" "   You haven't seen your Dad in over two years.  You must be so excited."
"4399" "Sokka" "   I know I should be, but I just feel sick to my stomach."
"4400" "Aang" "   Don't be nervous, he's going to be so happy to see you."
"4401" "Sokka" "  So what about you?  Are you nervous to meet this Guru?"
"4402" "Aang" "  Not at all.  I'm ready to master the Avatar State.  I'll do whatever it takes.   See you in a week.  Yip Yip!"
"4403" "Sokka" "   Hi Dad."
"4404" "Katara" "   Or we could send in Momo to do some damage."
"4405" "Katara" "  Cause the. . .  . . . sorry."
"4406" "Katara" "   I'll get these scrolls to him right away.  Thank you, General How."
"4407" "Aang" "   Um, hello?   You're Guru Pathik, right?  The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?"
"4408" "Aang" "  In your note, you said you could teach me to gain control of the Avatar State.  How?"
"4409" "Aang" "   Ugh!  It tastes like onion and banana juice!"
"4410" "Toph" "   Hey!  Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second?  I gotta go to the bathroom!"
"4411" "Toph" "   Let me out of here, so I can kick both your butts!"
"4412" "Aang" "   What are chakras?"
"4413" "Aang" "  So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?"
"4414" "Aang" "  The creek can't flow?"
"4415" "Aang" "   The energy flows!"
"4416" "Aang" "   I'll do whatever it takes."
"4417" "Aang" "   Ahhhhh!"
"4418" "Aang" "  Water chakra?"
"4419" "Aang" "  I ran away."
"4420" "Aang" "   I hurt all of those people."
"4421" "Sokka" "  Destructive, buoyant, and  terrible smelling."
"4422" "Sokka" "   Ha ha!  Good one Dad!"
"4423" "Sokka" "   Uh, what should I do, Dad?"
"4424" "Iroh" "  Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop.  Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you."
"4425" "Zuko" "   Congratulations Uncle."
"4426" "Iroh" "   I'm very thankful."
"4427" "Zuko" "   You deserve it.  The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city."
"4428" "Iroh" "  No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.   It means more than you know."
"4429" "Zuko" "   Now let's make these people some tea."
"4430" "Iroh" "   Yes!  Let's make some tea!"
"4431" "Aang" "   My Fire chakra would like to eat something other than onion- banana juice."
"4432" "Aang" "   I'm never going to fire bend again.  I can't."
"4433" "Aang" "   Urrp!  Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else.  Pickles?"
"4434" "Aang" "   Can I have some onion banana juice please?"
"4435" "Katara" "  Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?"
"4436" "Aang" "  Because I never wanted to be."
"4437" "Aang" "  Like the four nations."
"4438" "Aang" "  We're all connected.   Everything is connected."
"4439" "Toph" "   Come on metal. . . .  budge."
"4440" "Toph" "  Whoo!  Toph, you rule!"
"4441" "Katara" "  What do you say Momo?  A cup of tea before we get back to the king?   Table for two please."
"4442" "Zuko" "  Uncle, I need two jasmine, one green and one lychee!"
"4443" "Iroh" "   I'm brewing as fast as I can!"
"4444" "Aang" "   Let's do this."
"4445" "Aang" "   What?  Why would I let go of Katara?  I. . . I. . I love her."
"4446" "Aang" "   Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?  How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her?  Three chakras ago, that was a good thing."
"4447" "Katara" "  Thank goodness you are here, Suki.  Something terrible is going on.  The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city.  I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!   We have to tell the Earth King right away!"
"4448" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara."
"4449" "Aang" "   Okay, I'll try."
"4450" "Aang" "   Katara is in danger!  I have to go."
"4451" "Toph" "  It's not!  It's the real deal!"
"4452" "Toph" "  I am the greatest earthbender in the world!  Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!"
"4453" "Sokka" "   You don't know how much this means to me dad.  I'll make you proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am."
"4454" "Sokka" "  Really?"
"4455" "Sokka" "   This can't be good news."
"4456" "Iroh" "   I. . . I can't believe it."
"4457" "Zuko" "   What is it Uncle?"
"4458" "Iroh" "   Great news!  We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!  "
"4459" "Sokka" "  So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?"
"4460" "Aang" "   I don't know.  In my vision, I just knew she needed help."
"4461" "Sokka" "  It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time."
"4462" "Sokka" "  What is that? !"
"4463" "Sokka" "  Need a ride?"
"4464" "Toph" "  Ahhh!"
"4465" "Iroh" "  Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.  But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. . . instead, we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea.  Destiny is a funny thing."
"4466" "Zuko" "   It sure is Uncle."
"4467" "Toph" "  So how did it go with the Guru?  Did you master the Avatar State?"
"4468" "Sokka" "  Aang, are you ok?"
"4469" "Aang" "   I'm great.  It went great with the Guru.  I completely mastered the Avatar State.  Heh heh. . . heh.  Yeah."
"4470" "Zuko" "  What's taking so long?"
"4471" "Iroh" "  Maybe the Earth King overslept."
"4472" "Zuko" "  Something's not right."
"4473" "Zuko" "   Azula!"
"4474" "Iroh" "  Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the Dragon of the West?"
"4475" "Iroh" "  It's more of a demonstration really."
"4476" "Iroh" "  Come on.  You'll be fine."
"4477" "Zuko" "  No.  I'm tired of running.  It's time I faced Azula!"
"4478" "Zuko" "   Yes!  I challenge you!"
"4479" "Aang" "  But, in my vision.  I felt so sure that she was in trouble."
"4480" "Sokka" "  See Aang?  She's with Suki.  They're probably back at our apartment right now, talking about make up or something."
"4481" "Aang" "  Ok, maybe you're right."
"4482" "Katara" "   Zuko!"
"4483" "Aang" "  Momo!"
"4484" "Toph" "  There's no one else here."
"4485" "Aang" "  Katara is in trouble!  I knew it!"
"4486" "Sokka" "  Oh no."
"4487" "Toph" "  Wait, someone's at the door.   Actually, I know who it is.  It's an old friend of mine.    Glad to see you're okay."
"4488" "Iroh" "  I need your help."
"4489" "Aang" "   You guys know each other!"
"4490" "Toph" "  I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.  Then he gave me tea and very good advice."
"4491" "Iroh" "  May I come in?   Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se."
"4492" "Aang" "  She must have Katara."
"4493" "Iroh" "  She has captured my nephew as well."
"4494" "Aang" "  Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko."
"4495" "Sokka" "  Woah there.  You lost me at, Zuko."
"4496" "Iroh" "  I know how you must feel about my nephew.  But believe me when I tell you there is good inside him."
"4497" "Sokka" "  Good inside of him isn't enough.  Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?"
"4498" "Aang" "  Katara is in trouble.  All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.  Working together is our best chance."
"4499" "Iroh" "  I brought someone along who might be able to help us."
"4500" "Sokka" "   My sister!  Where are they keeping Katara?"
"4501" "Katara" "   Why did they throw you in here?  Oh wait.  Let me guess.  It's a trap.  So when Aang shows up to rescue me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches."
"4502" "Katara" "  You're a terrible person, you know that?  Always following us, hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!  But what do you care?  You're the Fire Lord's son.  Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood."
"4503" "Zuko" "  You don't know what you're talking about."
"4504" "Katara" "   I don't? !  How dare you!  You have no idea what this war has put me through.  Me personally .  The Fire Nation took my mother away from me."
"4505" "Zuko" "  I'm sorry.  That's something we have in common."
"4506" "Toph" "  Well whaddya know.  There is an ancient city down there, but it's deep."
"4507" "Sokka" "  We should split up.  Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk. . . no offense."
"4508" "Iroh" "  None taken."
"4509" "Sokka" "  And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup."
"4510" "Aang" "  So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice.  And great tea."
"4511" "Iroh" "  The key to both is proper aging.  What's on your mind?"
"4512" "Aang" "  Well, I met with this Guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State, and control this great power.  But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love, and I just couldn't."
"4513" "Iroh" "  Perfection and power are overrated.  I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love."
"4514" "Aang" "  What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula?  Without the Avatar State, what if I am not powerful enough?"
"4515" "Iroh" "  I don't know the answer.  Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel.  You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving. . ."
"4516" "Iroh" "  You will come to a better place."
"4517" "Sokka" "  There's General How!"
"4518" "Sokka" "  The coup is happening right now!  We've got to warn the Earth King!"
"4519" "Sokka" "  Thank goodness we're in time!"
"4520" "Sokka" "    Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki."
"4521" "Katara" "  I'm sorry I yelled at you before."
"4522" "Zuko" "  It doesn't matter."
"4523" "Katara" "  It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face."
"4524" "Zuko" "  My face.  I see ."
"4525" "Katara" "  No, no, that's not what I meant."
"4526" "Zuko" "  It's ok.  I used to think this scar marked me.  The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever.  But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark."
"4527" "Katara" "  Maybe you could be free of it."
"4528" "Zuko" "  What?"
"4529" "Katara" "  I have healing abilities."
"4530" "Zuko" "  It's a scar.  It can't be healed."
"4531" "Katara" "  This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole.  It has special properties, so I have be saving it forsomething important.   I don't know if it would work, but. . ."
"4532" "Katara" " Aang!"
"4533" "Zuko" "   Uncle, I don't understand.  What are you doing with the Avatar! !"
"4534" "Aang" "  Saving you, that's what."
"4535" "Iroh" "  Zuko, it's time we talked.   Go help your other friends.  We'll catch up with you."
"4536" "Zuko" "   Why Uncle?"
"4537" "Iroh" "  You are not the man you used to be, Zuko.  You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been.  And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.  It's time for you to choose.  It's time for you to choose good!"
"4538" "Zuko" "  Release him immediately!"
"4539" "Iroh" " The kind of redemption she offers is not for you."
"4540" "Iroh" "  Zuko, I am begging you, look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want."
"4541" "Katara" "  We've got to find Sokka and Toph."
"4542" "Toph" "  See any Dai Li agents near by?"
"4543" "Sokka" "  Nope.  All clear."
"4544" "Sokka" "  Let's go!"
"4545" "Katara" "  I thought you had changed!"
"4546" "Zuko" "  I have changed."
"4547" "Toph" "  That is a nice trick."
"4548" "Aang" "  There's too many."
"4549" "Aang" "  I 'm sorry Katara."
"4550" "Iroh" "  You've got to get out of here!  I'll hold them off as long as I can!"
"4551" "Zuko" "    I betrayed Uncle."
"4552" "Zuko" "  But I don't have the Avatar.  What if Father doesn't restore my honor?"
"4553" "Aang" "    What happened?"
"4554" "Aang" "  Oh no!"
"4555" "Aang" "   Momo?"
"4556" "Toph" "   Twinkle- Toes, that's got to be you."
"4557" "Katara" "  Aang, you're awake!"
"4558" "Aang" "  Are you sure?   I feel like I'm dreaming."
"4559" "Katara" "  You're not dreaming.  You're finally awake."
"4560" "Sokka" "  Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy."
"4561" "Aang" "   Sokka?"
"4562" "Toph" "  Uh- oh!  Somebody catch him, he's gonna. . ."
"4563" "Aang" "  Ughh."
"4564" "Zuko" "  I've got a lot on my mind.  It's been so long.  Over three years since I was home.  I wonder what's changed.  I wonder how I've changed."
"4565" "Aang" "   Why are we on a Fire Nation ship?  Why is everyone dressed this way?  And why am I the only one out of it?"
"4566" "Katara" "  You need to take it easy, o. k?  You got hurt pretty bad.  I like your hair."
"4567" "Aang" "   I have hair?  How long was I out?"
"4568" "Katara" "  A few weeks."
"4569" "Katara" "   We're fine, Dad."
"4570" "Katara" "   He knows who you are.  I just called you Dad, didn't I?"
"4571" "Aang" "  Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda ."
"4572" "Katara" "   Great, great.  Now you guys have finally met, so would you mind giving us a little privacy?"
"4573" "Aang" "  Are you mad at your dad or something?"
"4574" "Katara" "  What?  Not at all, why would you say that?"
"4575" "Aang" "  Mmm- emmm ."
"4576" "Katara" "  Maybe we should go upstairs.  You need a healing session."
"4577" "Katara" "  Tell me where your pain feels most intense."
"4578" "Aang" "  A little higher."
"4579" "Aang" "  Wow, you are definitely in the right area there."
"4580" "Katara" "  I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there.  Let me just see if I can. . ."
"4581" "Aang" "  I went down!  I didn't just get hurt, did I?  It was worse than that.  I was gone.  But you brought me back."
"4582" "Katara" "  I just used the spirit water from the North Pole.  I don't know what I did, exactly."
"4583" "Aang" "  You saved me."
"4584" "Katara" "   You need to rest."
"4585" "Sokka" "  After what happened in Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety."
"4586" "Sokka" "   We flew back to  Chameleon Bay, where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men."
"4587" "Sokka" "   The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone."
"4588" "Sokka" "   Well, not completely alone."
"4589" "Sokka" "   Soon, the bay was overrun with Fire Nation ships.  Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise."
"4590" "Sokka" "   Since then, we've been traveling west .  We crossed through The Serpent's Pass a few days ago.  We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us."
"4591" "Aang" "  So, what now?"
"4592" "Katara" "   It's Sokka's invasion plan."
"4593" "Sokka" "  So we're planning a smaller invasion.  Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom.  We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke."
"4594" "Sokka" "  And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage.   We have a secret .  You!"
"4595" "Aang" "  Me?"
"4596" "Sokka" "  Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead!   Isn't that great? !"
"4597" "Aang" "  The world thinks I'm dead?  How is that good news?  That's terrible!"
"4598" "Sokka" "  No, it's great.  It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore.  And even better, they won't expect you on The Day of Black Sun."
"4599" "Aang" "  No, no, no, no, no.  You have no idea.  This is so messed up!"
"4600" "Aang" "  I'll handle this.  The Avatar is back!"
"4601" "Katara" "  Aang, wait.  Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation."
"4602" "Aang" "   I hate not being able to do anything."
"4603" "Toph" "  Hopefully, you won't need to."
"4604" "Toph" "  They know!"
"4605" "Zuko" "  I haven't seen Dad yet.  I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished."
"4606" "Zuko" "  So, I didn't capture the Avatar."
"4607" "Katara" "  This is water from the Spirit Oasis, at the North Pole.  It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important."
"4608" "Zuko" "  No.  There's no way he could've survived."
"4609" "Toph" "  Load the Toph!"
"4610" "Katara" "  I'm gonna give us some cover!"
"4611" "Aang" "  I can't just stand by and do nothing!"
"4612" "Sokka" "  Aang!  No!"
"4613" "Sokka" "  You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret.  Just let us handle this."
"4614" "Aang" "  Fine!"
"4615" "Toph" "  How we doing?"
"4616" "Sokka" "  Things couldn't get much worse."
"4617" "Sokka" "  The Universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?"
"4618" "Toph" " You make it so easy!"
"4619" "Sokka" "  Thank you, The Universe!"
"4620" "Toph" "  Hey, Aang, we're going into town to find some dinner."
"4621" "Aang" "  Well, I am pretty hungry.  Maybe dinner's a good idea."
"4622" "Sokka" "   Here, tie this around your head.  It'll cover your arrow."
"4623" "Aang" "  I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly."
"4624" "Sokka" "  Aang, be practical."
"4625" "Katara" "  You guys go ahead without us.  We'll catch up with you."
"4626" "Katara" "  I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much.   You don't want people to think you failed."
"4627" "Aang" "  You're right, I don't.  But the problem is, I did fail."
"4628" "Katara" "  Aang, that's not true."
"4629" "Aang" "  It is true.  I was in Ba Sing Se.  I was there, but I lost.  And now, the Earth Kingdom has fallen for good."
"4630" "Katara" "  Remember, there's still an invasion plan."
"4631" "Aang" "   And I hate the invasion plan, too!  I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes.   I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord, but now, I know I need to do it alone."
"4632" "Katara" "  Aang."
"4633" "Aang" "  Katara, please.  Just go, please."
"4634" "Katara" "  Is there anything you need?"
"4635" "Aang" "  I need to redeem myself.  I need my honor back."
"4636" "Katara" "  I brought you some food."
"4637" "Katara" "  Oh no!"
"4638" "Katara" "  He left."
"4639" "Katara" "  Aang.  He just took his glider and disappeared.  He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone.  That it's all his responsibility."
"4640" "Katara" "   It's not brave.  It's selfish and stupid.  We could be helping him.  And I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much that we need him too?  How could he just leave us behind?"
"4641" "Katara" "   How could you leave us, Dad?  I mean, I know we had Gran Gran, and she loved us, but. . . but we were just so lost without you."
"4642" "Katara" "  I understand why you left.  I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way?  I was so sad and angry, and hurt."
"4643" "Zuko" "  What did you hear?"
"4644" "Aang" "  Blockade."
"4645" "Zuko" "  Why'd you do it?"
"4646" "Zuko" "  Why did you tell Father That I was the one who killed the Avatar?"
"4647" "Zuko" ""
"4648" "Zuko" "  But why?"
"4649" "Zuko" "  You're lying."
"4650" "Zuko" "  You have another motive for doing this.  I just haven't figure out what it is."
"4651" "Aang" "  I'm not gonna make it.  I failed."
"4652" "Aang" "  Roku?"
"4653" "Aang" "  But everyone thinks I am dead again.  They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war.  I'm letting the whole world down."
"4654" "Aang" "  I don't know."
"4655" "Aang" "  You're right.  I won't give up."
"4656" "Katara" "  You're ok!"
"4657" "Aang" "  I have so much to do."
"4658" "Katara" "  I know, but you'll have our help."
"4659" "Toph" "  You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?"
"4660" "Aang" "  What about the invasion?"
"4661" "Sokka" "  We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force on the day of the eclipse."
"4662" "Toph" "  Hey, what's. . .   Oh. . . it's your glider."
"4663" "Aang" "  That's okay.  If someone saw it, it would give away my identity.  It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive."
"4664" "Aang" "  I think I see a cave below."
"4665" "Sokka" "  Shhush. . .  keep quiet!   Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud who knows how to keep its mouth shut."
"4666" "Toph" "   Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in."
"4667" "Sokka" "  Hey!  We're in enemy territory.  Those are enemy birds."
"4668" "Sokka" "  Well, this is it.  This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.  Hiding in cave after cave. . . after cave. . . after cave. . ."
"4669" "Katara" "  Sokka, we don't need to become cave people.  What we need is some new clothes."
"4670" "Aang" "  Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out.  If we get Fire Nation disguises, we'll be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave."
"4671" "Toph" "  Plus. . . they have real food out there.  Does anyone wanna sit in the dirt and eat cave- hoppers?"
"4672" "Sokka" "   Looks like we got out voted, sport.   Let's get some new clothes."
"4673" "Aang" "  I don't know about this.  These clothes belong to somebody."
"4674" "Katara" " I call the silk robe!"
"4675" "Aang" "  But if it's essential to our survival. . . then I call the suit!"
"4676" "Aang" "  Ta- dah!  Normal kid."
"4677" "Toph" "  Hmm. . . I should probably wear shoes, but then I won't be able to see as well.  Sorry shoes!   Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender."
"4678" "Katara" "  How do I look?"
"4679" "Aang" "  Uh. . . your mom's necklace."
"4680" "Katara" "   Oh. . . oh, yeah.  I guess it's pretty obviously water tribe, isn't it?"
"4681" "Aang" "  I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago.  So everyone just follow my lead and stay cool.  Or as they say in the Fire Nation -  Stay flamin'!   Greetings, my good Hotman!"
"4682" "Aang" "  Oh, we're going to a meat place?"
"4683" "Sokka" "  Come on, Aang.  Every one here eats meat. . . even the meat!"
"4684" "Aang" "   You guys go ahead.  I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage."
"4685" "Aang" "  Hotman.  Hotman.  Hotman.  Hotman.  Hotman."
"4686" "Aang" "  Who me?"
"4687" "Aang" "  Heh, heh.  Uh!"
"4688" "Aang" "  That's right.   Let the molding begin. Ms."
"4689" "Aang" "   Yeah, the colonies.  Of course.  The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. Ms."
"4690" "Aang" "  Sorry ma'am. Ms."
"4691" "Aang" "  Um, I have a scar.  It's really embarrassing. Ms."
"4692" "Aang" "   Just Slob is fine.   Or, uh. . .  Kuzon."
"4693" "Aang" "  We made it through the day, Momo.  And. . . it was pretty fun!"
"4694" "Aang" "   What monkey?"
"4695" "Aang" "  Wow.   You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about."
"4696" "Aang" "  It was nice meeting you."
"4697" "Aang" "   I guess I'm just lucky."
"4698" "Aang" "  I'd love to!"
"4699" "Katara" "  Where have you been?  We've been worried sick!"
"4700" "Aang" "   I got invited to play with some kids after school."
"4701" "Sokka" "   After what?"
"4702" "Aang" "   I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow."
"4703" "Sokka" "  Enrolled in what? !"
"4704" "Zuko" "   I'm going in for a visit.  You're gonna stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this."
"4705" "Zuko" "  Uncle.  It's me."
"4706" "Sokka" "  Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea.  But it sounds. . . really terrible."
"4707" "Toph" "  Yeah, we got our outfits.  What do you need to go to school for?"
"4708" "Aang" "  Every minute I'm in that classroom.  I'm learning new things about the fire nation.  I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.   And here's one that I made out of noodles!"
"4709" "Sokka" "  Impressive, I admit.  But I still think it's too dangerous."
"4710" "Aang" "   I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then.  It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace.  We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow. . ."
"4711" "Sokka" "  Hmm. . .  I am a fan of secret rivers.   Fine, let's stay a few more days."
"4712" "Aang" "  Flamey- o, Hotman!"
"4713" "Sokka" "   Flamey- o? ?"
"4714" "Katara" "   Mmm- mm?"
"4715" "Zuko" "   You brought this on yourself, you know.  We could have returned together.  You could have been a hero!   You have no right to judge me Uncle.  I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.   You're not gonna say anything?   Argh!  You're a crazy old man!  You're crazy, and if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! Ms."
"4716" "Aang" "  Fire Lord. . . forefathers. . ."
"4717" "Aang" "   Firebenders. . . Fire Lord. . . blah, blah, blah, blah. Ms."
"4718" "Aang" "   Is that a trick question?  The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military.  Sozin defeated them by ambush. Ms."
"4719" "Aang" "   I'll just write down my best guess."
"4720" "Aang" "   I know.  I'm a terrible Tsungi hornist."
"4721" "Aang" "  I was just dancing.  You do dances here in the homeland, right?"
"4722" "Aang" "  But what about expressing yourself?"
"4723" "Aang" "  Thanks, On Ji.  I could show it to you again, if you'd like."
"4724" "Aang" "  Just some dance movements."
"4725" "Aang" "  Parents?  But. . ."
"4726" "Sokka" "  Fire!  Wang Fire.  This is my wife, Sapphire."
"4727" "Katara" "  Sapphire Fire, nice to meet you."
"4728" "Katara" "  My goodness!  That doesn't sound like our Kuzon."
"4729" "Sokka" "  Don't you worry, Mr.  Headmaster.  I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce.   Young man, as soon as we get home, you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!"
"4730" "Zuko" "   You're so beautiful when you hate the world."
"4731" "Zuko" "  I don't hate you, too."
"4732" "Zuko" "  Can't you see we're busy?"
"4733" "Zuko" "   That guard told you."
"4734" "Zuko" "   Okay, you caught me.  What is it that you want, Azula?"
"4735" "Sokka" "  That settles it.  No more school for you young man!"
"4736" "Aang" "  I'm not ready to leave.  I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid.  You don't know what it's like, Sokka.  You get to be normal all the time."
"4737" "Toph" "   Ha, ha."
"4738" "Aang" "  Listen, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation.  If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom."
"4739" "Sokka" "  What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?"
"4740" "Aang" "  I'm gonna throw them. . ."
"4741" "Sokka" "   Go to your room!"
"4742" "Aang" "  Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork."
"4743" "Toph" "  They're coming!  Everyone stop bending!"
"4744" "Aang" "   Sorry, buddy.  You should probably wait out back.   I know, you've got fancier feet than anybody. . . and six of 'em!"
"4745" "Aang" "  Ladies and gentlemen, The Flamey- os!  Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving."
"4746" "Aang" "  This is when you start dancing."
"4747" "Aang" "  Oh, boy.  Listen, guys. . . dancing isn't something you think about.  It's a form of self- expression that no one can ever take away from you."
"4748" "Aang" "  Sure you do.  You have for generations.  It just so happens that I know several classic fire nation dances.  A hundred years ago, this was known as The Phoenix Flight."
"4749" "Aang" "  And this was the Camelephant Strut."
"4750" "Toph" "  Who knew Twinkletoes could dance?"
"4751" "Zuko" "  I brought you some komodo- chicken.  I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food.   I admit it.  I have everything I always wanted, but it's not at all how I thought it would be.  The truth is, I need your advice.   I think the Avatar is still alive.  I know he's out there.  I'm losing my mind.   Please, Uncle, I'm so confused!  I need your help.   Forget it!  I'll solve this myself!  Waste away in here for all I care!"
"4752" "Aang" "  And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se."
"4753" "Sokka" "  Wow, they look pretty good together."
"4754" "Katara" "   Eh, if that's what you like."
"4755" "Aang" "  Yeah, that's it.  That's the sound of happy feet.  All right, go with that.  Everybody freestyle!"
"4756" "Katara" "  I don't know, Aang.  These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I'm not sure that I know how to. . ."
"4757" "Aang" "   Take my hand."
"4758" "Katara" "  Okay."
"4759" "Katara" "  Aang, everyone's watching."
"4760" "Aang" "  Don't worry about them.  It's just you and me right now."
"4761" "Aang" "  Uh- oh."
"4762" "Katara" "  We're safe, Sokka.  You can take off the moustache, now."
"4763" "Sokka" "   Oh, no, I can't.  It's permanently glued to my skin."
"4764" "Toph" "  Way to go, Dancypants.  I think you really did help those kids.  You taught them to be free."
"4765" "Aang" "  I don't know.  It was just a dance party, that's all."
"4766" "Katara" "  Well, that was some dance party, Aang."
"4767" "Sokka" "   Flamey- o, sir.  Flame- ee- o."
"4768" "Zuko" "  You're sure you weren't followed?   I've heard about you.  They say you're good at what you do.  And even better at keeping secrets.  The Avatar's alive.  I want you to find him.   And end him."
"4769" "Aang" "   Momo!   Oh Momo!   Ah!  Ha ha, you found me, buddy.   Hey guys, I think this river's polluted."
"4770" "Sokka" "   Well, that explains why I can't catch a fish around here.  Because normally my fishing skills are. . .  off the hook!  Get it?  Like a fishing hook?"
"4771" "Toph" "  Too bad your skills aren't on the hook."
"4772" "Katara" "  It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food.   Assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule."
"4773" "Sokka" "  Hm. . . it's doable.  But that means only two potty breaks today!"
"4774" "Aang" "  Hey, maybe we can get food there."
"4775" "Aang" "  Now you look just like a little hill with horns.  Bye buddy!"
"4776" "Toph" "  I don't feel anything.  Where is this village?"
"4777" "Sokka" "  It's in the middle of the river!"
"4778" "Katara" "  We're, um, from the Earth Kingdom colonies."
"4779" "Katara" "  Why do you guys live on the river?"
"4780" "Aang" "  Thanks for the ride!"
"4781" "Katara" "  Look at this place.  It's so sad.  We have to do something to help."
"4782" "Sokka" "  No, we can't waste our time here!  We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on.  These people are on their own!"
"4783" "Katara" "  These people are starving, but you turn your back on them? !  How can you be so cold and heartless?"
"4784" "Sokka" "  I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic!  We can't go around helping every rinky- dink town we wander into.  We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord!"
"4785" "Toph" "   Hey, loudmouth!  Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about taking out theFire Lord."
"4786" "Sokka" "   Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this.  You know our mission has to come first."
"4787" "Katara" "   I guess so."
"4788" "Aang" "  Let's just get what we need and go."
"4789" "Sokka" "  Hey, Dock.  You work here too?"
"4790" "Aang" "  But we just saw you.  You're even wearing the same clothes.  The only difference is your hat."
"4791" "Aang" "  I don't get it."
"4792" "Sokka" "  We'll just take the fish.  Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?"
"4793" "Katara" "   I wish I could spare more."
"4794" "Sokka" "  Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule.  It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track."
"4795" "Toph" "    Finagle away, O schedule master."
"4796" "Sokka" "  Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty- three minutes earlier every day."
"4797" "Katara" "  Forty- three minutes?"
"4798" "Sokka" "  Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse -  which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes.  And we just lost a whole day.  So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!"
"4799" "Toph" "  Well,I'm not waking up early."
"4800" "Sokka" "  Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks."
"4801" "Aang" "  What?"
"4802" "Katara" "  No way."
"4803" "Toph" "  Forget it."
"4804" "Sokka" "  I got it, how's this From now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time."
"4805" "Sokka" "  Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient.  Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning."
"4806" "Aang" "  What's the matter, Katara?"
"4807" "Katara" "  I think Appa's sick."
"4808" "Sokka" "  What, Appa's sick?  That's awful!"
"4809" "Toph" "  Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much."
"4810" "Sokka" "  Of course I care.  I might as well just throw our schedule away now.   And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well."
"4811" "Toph" "  He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water."
"4812" "Aang" "  He doesn't look sick.  You okay, buddy?   His tongue is purple!  That can't be good.  Katara, can you heal him?"
"4813" "Katara" "  It looks like he needs some medicine.  Maybe we can find the right herbs in town."
"4814" "Toph" "  Is it just me, or does this place seem different?"
"4815" "Aang" "  Yeah, are the people. . . happier?"
"4816" "Sokka" "  Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?"
"4817" "Katara" "  The Painted who now?"
"4818" "Sokka" "  See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them.  All we need is medicine for our sick friend."
"4819" "Katara" "  Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest."
"4820" "Sokka" "    I guess you're right.  You got any more food to sell?"
"4821" "Sokka" "    Two- headed!   What?  You get more for your money that way."
"4822" "Sokka" "  Hi, Dock.  Is Xu around?"
"4823" "Toph" "  We need more food.  Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better."
"4824" "Sokka" "   And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing- along."
"4825" "Aang" "  Is that why this place seems so festive?"
"4826" "Katara" "  Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady?  I mean. . .  spirit?"
"4827" "Sokka" "  Well, I hope she returns every night.  Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was."
"4828" "Katara" "   Why would you say that?  Look how much better off these people are."
"4829" "Sokka" "  Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves.  If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.   Oooooo. . .  pow."
"4830" "Aang" "  Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka.  It's more like. . .  Woooooo. . . ."
"4831" "Aang" "  What's the matter, buddy?   It's her!   Hello, Painted Lady spirit!   Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule.  Wait, but I'm the great bridge between your world and mine.  I know Hei Bai, we're close personal friends.   Heeeyy! !"
"4832" "Aang" "  My name's Aang.  I'm the Avatar."
"4833" "Katara" "    Well, hello, Avatar.  I wish I could talk, but I am very busy."
"4834" "Aang" "  Yeah, me too.  I hate that.   You know, you're really pretty for a spirit.  I don't get to meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet. . . not very attractive."
"4835" "Katara" "    Thank you, but. . ."
"4836" "Aang" "  You seem familiar, too."
"4837" "Katara" "  A lot of people say that."
"4838" "Aang" "  No. . . you really seem familiar."
"4839" "Katara" "  Look, I really should get going. . ."
"4840" "Aang" "  Katara !"
"4841" "Katara" "   Hi, Aang."
"4842" "Aang" "  You're the Painted Lady !  But how?"
"4843" "Katara" "  I wasn't at first, I was just trying to help the village.  But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway. . . I guess I just kind of became her."
"4844" "Aang" "  So you've been sneaking out at night?  Wait. . ."
"4845" "Aang" "  I can't believe you lied to everyone so you could help these people."
"4846" "Katara" "  I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have."
"4847" "Aang" "  No, I think it's great!  You're like a secret hero."
"4848" "Katara" "  Well, if you want to help. . . there's one more thing I have to do."
"4849" "Aang" "  You want to destroy this factory?"
"4850" "Katara" "  Yes.  Sokka was just kidding, but he was right.  Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently."
"4851" "Aang" "   Ha ha!"
"4852" "Katara" "  Shhh, we don't want to wake Sokka.   Hi!  Sokka!  We were just. . . out on a. . . morning walk!"
"4853" "Sokka" "  Oh, really?  A morning walk?   I know you're the Painted Lady.  I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and feeding him purplizing tongue berries!   Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy.  We're leaving right now.   And how long did you know about this?"
"4854" "Aang" "  Hey, I just found out this morning."
"4855" "Toph" "  What's going on?"
"4856" "Aang" "  Fire Nation soldiers are heading to the village."
"4857" "Sokka" "   What did you do? !"
"4858" "Katara" "   I. . . kind of destroyed their factory."
"4859" "Sokka" "  You what? !"
"4860" "Katara" "  It was your idea!"
"4861" "Sokka" "  I was joking.  I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises.  Did you even think this through?  The army's gonna blame the villagers.  They're headed there right now to get revenge."
"4862" "Katara" "  Well, what was I supposed to do?"
"4863" "Sokka" "  Leave!  Do nothing!"
"4864" "Katara" "   No.  I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me.   I'm going down to the village, and I am gonna do whatever I can."
"4865" "Sokka" "  Wait.  I'm coming too."
"4866" "Katara" "  I thought you didn't want to help."
"4867" "Sokka" "   You need me, and I will never turn my back on you."
"4868" "Katara" "  Sokka.  You really do have a heart."
"4869" "Aang" "   He really does have a heart, doesn't he?"
"4870" "Katara" "  Leave this village and never come back."
"4871" "Sokka" "  Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you.  Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone.  You should be down on your knees thanking her."
"4872" "Katara" "  Sokka, it's okay.   I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you.  But I felt like I had to do something.  It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not.  Because your problems are real, and this river is real.  You can't wait around for someone to help you.  You have to help yourself."
"4873" "Toph" "  Maybe we can clean the river."
"4874" "Sokka" "  You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?"
"4875" "Katara" "  So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?"
"4876" "Aang" "  Aha, I knew it!  I knew you were the same guy.  You're the shop owner and the boat guy."
"4877" "Aang" "   No, I just saw you!  You switched hats and called yourself a different name!"
"4878" "Katara" "  Wow, this is amazing to watch."
"4879" "Sokka" "  Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are."
"4880" "Toph" "  Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it 1,000 times."
"4881" "Sokka" "  Oh, man.  You've never notseen anything like this."
"4882" "Katara" "  The fire is gonna destroy that town."
"4883" "Aang" "  Not if we can stop it."
"4884" "Katara" "  There's a creek over here.  I'll bend the water on to the fire."
"4885" "Aang" "  Toph, let's make a trench to keep the fire from coming any closer."
"4886" "Sokka" "   What should I do?"
"4887" "Aang" ""
"4888" "Aang" "   Sokka, stand clear."
"4889" "Sokka" "   Right, stand clear.  Got it."
"4890" "Aang" "   Good work, everybody."
"4891" "Aang" "  These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night."
"4892" "Toph" "   Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is we don't get the hero worship anymore.  I miss the love."
"4893" "Sokka" "   Boo- hoo, poor heroes."
"4894" "Katara" "  What's your problem?  You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug."
"4895" "Sokka" "  It's just. . . all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around, and making other stuff fly around.  I can't fly around, ok  I can't do anything."
"4896" "Katara" "  That's not true.  No one can read a map like you."
"4897" "Toph" "  I can't read at all."
"4898" "Aang" "  Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time I mean, look at Katara's hair, right  What's up with that?"
"4899" "Katara" "   What?  What's wrong with my hair?"
"4900" "Aang" "   Nothing, I was just trying to. . ."
"4901" "Sokka" "  Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special, and I'm not.  I'm just the guy in the group who's regular."
"4902" "Katara" "   I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know none of us see you that way.   I know something that's gonna make you feel better."
"4903" "Sokka" "   You do?"
"4904" "Sokka" "   Shopping!"
"4905" "Sokka" "  Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.   Hey, how about these  Ho- ya!  Smack- a- dacka- doo!"
"4906" "Aang" "   What do you think?   Pretty slick, huh?   All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword."
"4907" "Katara" "   What's a wind sword?"
"4908" "Aang" "  It's where I get a sword handle.  And then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade."
"4909" "Katara" "  Yeah. . . nice."
"4910" "Aang" "  I'll just stick to what I got."
"4911" "Sokka" "  Ooo.   That's what Sokka's talking about."
"4912" "Aang" "  That's it.  That's what you needed all along, Sokka."
"4913" "Sokka" "  A sword?"
"4914" "Aang" "  Not the sword. . . a master.   We've all had masters to help us get better.  You should see if you can study with Piandao."
"4915" "Katara" "  That's a great idea.  I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku.  Everyone needs a teacher."
"4916" "Toph" "  I learned from badger moles.  They don't talk, but they're still good teachers."
"4917" "Sokka" "   It would be nice to be a master swordfighter.  All right, I'll talk to him."
"4918" "Sokka" "  I've come to train with The Master."
"4919" "Sokka" "  Well, uh. . ."
"4920" "Sokka" "  Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword."
"4921" "Sokka" "   Oh, uh, really?  Uh, where I come from, The Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name, for Fire Nation colonials."
"4922" "Sokka" "  Well, actually, I've been all over the world."
"4923" "Sokka" "  And I know one thing for sure,  I have a lot to learn."
"4924" "Sokka" "  I know.  Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth.  But the truth is. . . I don't know if I am worthy."
"4925" "Sokka" "  Like a second head."
"4926" "Aang" "  What should we do today?"
"4927" "Toph" "  I'm tapped out.  I already picked my toes, twice."
"4928" "Aang" "  Twice?"
"4929" "Toph" "  The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the sweet picking sensation."
"4930" "Katara" "  Sokka's been in charge of the schedule.  I'm not sure what we should be doing."
"4931" "Toph" "   Plus, it's so hot today."
"4932" "Aang" "   How hot is it?"
"4933" "Toph" "  I don't know.  Real hot?"
"4934" "Katara" "  It's so hot, it's so hot. . .  Momo is shedding like Appa.   Huh, huh?"
"4935" "Aang" "  I guess the jokes don't run in the family."
"4936" "Katara" "  Oh, everyone's a critic."
"4937" "Sokka" "   Writing my name will make me a better swordsman?"
"4938" "Sokka" "  I am?   I am.  So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?"
"4939" "Sokka" "  I'm finished."
"4940" "Sokka" "   Is that ok?"
"4941" "Sokka" "  Hm, manipulate them to my advantage.  Oh!"
"4942" "Sokka" "  Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me?"
"4943" "Katara" "  So where are we going next?   We're starting from here."
"4944" "Aang" "   No, we're over on this island."
"4945" "Toph" "   You noodle- brains don't know what you're doing.  I miss Sokka."
"4946" "Katara" "  Ooh, I got one.  If you miss him so much, why don't you marry him?"
"4947" "Sokka" "  I have?  But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on."
"4948" "Sokka" "   Are you giving me one of yours?"
"4949" "Sokka" "  Master, would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword?"
"4950" "Toph" "  Sokka's coming!"
"4951" "Sokka" "  Hey, guys.  What are you doing?"
"4952" "Aang" "  Sokka!"
"4953" "Toph" "  You're back."
"4954" "Katara" "  We missed you so much."
"4955" "Aang" "  Say something funny."
"4956" "Sokka" "  Funny how?"
"4957" "Sokka" "  What's their deal?"
"4958" "Toph" "  I don't know.  They missed you or something.  I didn't care."
"4959" "Sokka" "  Thanks.  That warms my heart.  Anyway, I need some help."
"4960" "Sokka" "  Oh, these are my friends.  Just other good Fire Nation folks.   Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite?"
"4961" "Sokka" "  I'm sorry, Master.  You're wrong.  I am not worthy.  I'm not who you think I am.  I'm not from the Fire Nation.  I'm from the Southern Water Tribe.   I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you.  I'm sorry."
"4962" "Sokka" "  No, this is my fight, alone."
"4963" "Aang" "  How did you know?"
"4964" "Katara" "  But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe?"
"4965" "Sokka" "  It's a Pai Sho tile."
"4966" "Aang" "  The white lotus.  Hm."
"4967" "Katara" "  What does it mean?"
"4968" "Sokka" "  I have no idea.   Ooh, that reminds me.  Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before."
"4969" "Toph" "  Sweet.  Check this out."
"4970" "Katara" "  You know, I don't think there's such a thing as space earth.  If it's from space, then it's not really earth."
"4971" "Sokka" "  Must you ruin everything?"
"4972" "Katara" "  I can't believe I missed you."
"4973" "Zuko" "  Doing nothing is a waste of time.   We're being sent away on a forced vacation.   I feel like a child."
"4974" "Zuko" "  That was a long time ago."
"4975" "Zuko" "  It smells like old lady in here."
"4976" "Toph" "   Aang, I know swimming is fun and all,  but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that   Cover up!"
"4977" "Aang" "   What?  I'm wearing trunks."
"4978" "Toph" "  I know. . . it's your tattoos  I'm worried about.  What if someone sees you?"
"4979" "Katara" "   There are walls all around us.  It's completely safe."
"4980" "Aang" "   Whoo, hey!"
"4981" "Aang" "   Let's go again!"
"4982" "Zuko" "  Here. . .   This is for you."
"4983" "Zuko" "  I saw it and I thought it was pretty.  Don't girls like stuff like this?"
"4984" "Zuko" "   Forget it!"
"4985" "Zuko" "   I thought since it's so hot. . .  Here."
"4986" "Zuko" "  Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?"
"4987" "Zuko" "   Pft.  He thinks he's so great.   Well, what do you think of him?"
"4988" "Zuko" "  You like him, don't you?"
"4989" "Zuko" "  I know."
"4990" "Zuko" "  So what?"
"4991" "Zuko" "  Sure."
"4992" "Zuko" "   Hey, watch it!  That food was for my cranky girlfriend."
"4993" "Zuko" "   Stop talking to my girlfriend!"
"4994" "Zuko" "  What's wrong with me? !"
"4995" "Zuko" "  Well, at least I feel something. . . as opposed to you.  You have no passion for anything.   You're just a big blah."
"4996" "Zuko" "   I was just leaving."
"4997" "Zuko" "  Those summers we spent here seem so long ago.  So much has changed."
"4998" "Zuko" "   Where's your new boyfriend?   Are you cold?"
"4999" "Zuko" "   I'll make a fire.   There's plenty of stuff to burn in there.  We can.  Jump on Appa.  I'll try todistract him."
"5000" "Aang" "   I'm ok."
"5001" "Toph" "  Well, that was random."
"5002" "Katara" "  I don't think so.  I get the feeling he knows who we are."
"5003" "Zuko" "  What does it look like I'm doing?"
"5004" "Zuko" "  You think I care?"
"5005" "Zuko" "  You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business!"
"5006" "Zuko" "  No, you don't.   You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world, where everything's great all the time."
"5007" "Zuko" "   'I'm so pretty, look at me.  I can walk on my hands, whoo! '  Circus freak!"
"5008" "Zuko" "  Yeah, you don't believe in anything."
"5009" "Zuko" "  I'm sorry, too.  I wish you would be high- strung and crazy for once,  instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside.  She just called your aura dingy.  Are you gonna take that?"
"5010" "Zuko" "  I like it when you express yourself."
"5011" "Zuko" "  My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai."
"5012" "Zuko" "   Bad skin?   Normal teenagers worry about bad skin.  I don't have that luxury.  My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face."
"5013" "Zuko" "  For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.  I'm back home, now my dad talks to me.  Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero.   Everything should be perfect, right  I should be happy now, but I'm not.  I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why."
"5014" "Zuko" "  No one,  I'm just angry."
"5015" "Zuko" "  Everyone. . .   I don't know."
"5016" "Zuko" "  No, no!"
"5017" "Zuko" "  No, no. . .  No, no."
"5018" "Zuko" "   I'm angry at myself!"
"5019" "Zuko" "  Because I'm confused.  Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore."
"5020" "Zuko" "  I guess you wouldn't understand,  would you, Azula  Because you're just so perfect."
"5021" "Zuko" "  Party's over."
"5022" "Aang" "   Okay, Roku."
"5023" "Zuko" "   You need to know the story of your great- grandfather's demise.  It will reveal your own destiny."
"5024" "Aang" "  There it is.  That's Roku's home."
"5025" "Katara" "   But there's nothing here."
"5026" "Toph" "   Yes, there is.  An entire village.  Hundredsof houses.   All completely buried in ash."
"5027" "Zuko" "  Wait.  I need to ask you something.  What do you remember about our Great- Grandfather's history?"
"5028" "Zuko" "   But how did he die?"
"5029" "Zuko" "   What does it mean?   The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragon Bone Catacombs."
"5030" "Zuko" "   The final testament of Fire Lord Sozin."
"5031" "Aang" "   Where are we going?"
"5032" "Aang" "   You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin? !"
"5033" "Aang" "  You don't have to tell me."
"5034" "Aang" "  Wait, whose party is it?"
"5035" "Katara" "   Do they have bathrooms in the spirit world?"
"5036" "Sokka" "   As a matter of fact, they do not."
"5037" "Aang" "   Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple."
"5038" "Aang" "   No way."
"5039" "Aang" "  ) He's air- surfing.  I can't believe I never thought of that."
"5040" "Aang" "   That's amazing.  I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was."
"5041" "Aang" "   Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you were alive."
"5042" "Aang" "   This is amazing, Roku.  You're battling a volcano, and you're winning."
"5043" "Aang" "   Who's. . .  wait, that's me, isn't it?"
"5044" "Aang" "   Roku?  Roku?"
"5045" "Zuko" "   That can't be it, where's the rest of it?"
"5046" "Zuko" "   You sent this, didn't you?  I found the secret history.  Which, by the way should be renamed the history most people already know.  The note said that I needed to know about my great- grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end."
"5047" "Iroh" "   No. . . he wasn't."
"5048" "Zuko" "   What are you talking about?"
"5049" "Iroh" "  You have more than one great- grandfather, Prince Zuko.  Sozin was your father's grandfather.  Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku."
"5050" "Zuko" "   Why are you telling me this?"
"5051" "Iroh" "  Because understanding the struggle between your two great- grandfathers, can help you better understand the battle within yourself.  Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko.  It is your nature, your legacy.  But there is a bright side.  What happened generations ago can be resolved now. . .  by you.  Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the fire nation.  Born in you, along with all this strife, is the power to restore balance to the world."
"5052" "Iroh" "  This is a royal artifact.  It's supposed to be worn by the crown prince."
"5053" "Katara" "   You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together. . .  even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that?"
"5054" "Toph" "  It's like these people are born bad."
"5055" "Aang" "  No, that's wrong.  I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all."
"5056" "Sokka" "   Then what was the point?"
"5057" "Aang" "  Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right?  If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.  Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.  And I also think it was about friendships."
"5058" "Toph" "  Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?"
"5059" "Aang" "   I don't see why not."
"5060" "Sokka" "   Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that. ."
"5061" "Katara" "   Oh, Sokka, just hold hands."
"5062" "Toph" "  How could you do this to me?  You betrayed me!"
"5063" "Katara" "  You brought this on yourself.  I had no choice."
"5064" "Aang" "  Ok, I'm ready for some training!"
"5065" "Toph" "  Good job, twinkle- toes.  Visualize -  then attack!"
"5066" "Katara" "   Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph."
"5067" "Toph" "   What's the matter?  Can't handle some dirt, Madame Fussy Britches?"
"5068" "Katara" "  Oh, sorry, did I splash you, mud slug?"
"5069" "Aang" "   Are we taking a break?"
"5070" "Sokka" "  Yaaaaaah, sneak attack!"
"5071" "Aang" "  Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud."
"5072" "Toph" "  Hungry for a mud pie?"
"5073" "Katara" "  I'll give you a mud pie."
"5074" "Aang" "  Uh, guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me."
"5075" "Katara" "   Very well, pupil.  I believe we've had enough training for today."
"5076" "Toph" "   While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!"
"5077" "Sokka" "  Look at all those messenger hawks.  You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself.  That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. . .  I could just send them messages!"
"5078" "Toph" "   I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you."
"5079" "Aang" "  So, guys, what are we gonna get with our last silver piece?"
"5080" "Toph" "  We can get more money.  Right there.   This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage.  Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute.  But I can feel it with my earthbending."
"5081" "Toph" "  How could I possibly play?  I'm blind."
"5082" "Aang" "  Flamey- o, Toph!"
"5083" "Toph" "  More interesting?  How?"
"5084" "Toph" "  I'll do it for forty silver pieces."
"5085" "Toph" "  I won!"
"5086" "Katara" "   Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?"
"5087" "Aang" "  Toph got us money.  She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky- like."
"5088" "Sokka" "  She used earthbending to win the game.  Classic!"
"5089" "Katara" "  Ah, so she cheated."
"5090" "Toph" "  Hey, I only cheated because he was cheating.  I cheated a cheater.  What's wrong with that?"
"5091" "Katara" "  I'm just saying, this isn't something we should make a habit of doing."
"5092" "Toph" "  Why?  Because its fun, and you hate fun?"
"5093" "Katara" "   I don't hate fun.   See?  Fun."
"5094" "Aang" "  Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams."
"5095" "Katara" "  Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough.  If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen."
"5096" "Toph" "  Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?"
"5097" "Katara" "  Oh, I'm sorry.  You think I should be more like you?  Like some wild child?"
"5098" "Toph" "  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe then, you'd see how great we have it.  I mean, look at us.  We're traveling around the world, making easy money, having fun, with no parents to tell us what to do."
"5099" "Katara" "  Ah, I see.  You're acting like this because of your parents."
"5100" "Toph" "   Whatever."
"5101" "Katara" "  They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist.  You act like you hate them, but you don't.  You just feel guilty."
"5102" "Toph" "  I do hate them!"
"5103" "Katara" "  I don't think so.  I think you miss them.  But you just don't want to deal with that, so instead, you act like this crazy person."
"5104" "Toph" "  Look.  I ran away to help Aang!"
"5105" "Katara" "  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that.  We've already got some third- eyed freak after us."
"5106" "Sokka" "  Speaking of that third- eyed freak. . .  I think I've come up with a name for him.  What do you think of. . . Sparky- Sparky Boom Man!   Just think about it."
"5107" "Katara" "  We have enough money.  You need to stop this!"
"5108" "Toph" "  I'll stop when I want to stop, and not when you tell me!"
"5109" "Sokka" "  Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some.  See you guys later  Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar.  My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner.  And as such, I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't want to see any fighting.   Good wittle messenger Hawky.  Who's got pwetty feathers?   You're right, Hawky.  This is bad."
"5110" "Sokka" "  Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like."
"5111" "Toph" "  Well, it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper."
"5112" "Sokka" "  It's a wanted poster.  Of you.  They've nicknamed you The Runaway."
"5113" "Toph" "   A wanted poster.  That's so great.  The Runaway.  I love my new nickname.  Is there a picture of me?  Does it look good?"
"5114" "Sokka" "  Well, yeah, actually, it does look pretty good.  But Toph, you're missing the point.  Maybe Katara was right.  These scams are drawing too much attention to us."
"5115" "Toph" "  Don't be such a worrywart like your sister.  Think of it this way.  Now you have plenty of money to help with the invasion plan!"
"5116" "Sokka" "  Well, that is true.  I had this idea of making armor for Appa."
"5117" "Toph" "  Here's a little extra so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation.  You know what?  Make it an atlas."
"5118" "Sokka" "  I do like expensive atlases."
"5119" "Toph" "  Of course you do.  And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret."
"5120" "Katara" "  Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird."
"5121" "Sokka" "  Not just a bird.  A messenger bird!  Now we can send messages all over the world, even to Gran- Gran."
"5122" "Aang" "  Wow, how does it work?"
"5123" "Sokka" "  Hm, uh, I never actually thought about that."
"5124" "Katara" "  Well, look who decided to join us.  Where have you two been?  Off scamming again?"
"5125" "Toph" "  Yes, we were."
"5126" "Katara" "  And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?"
"5127" "Toph" "  No, I don't."
"5128" "Katara" "  Really?"
"5129" "Toph" "  Yes, really."
"5130" "Katara" "  Well then, what's this?"
"5131" "Toph" "   I don't know!  I mean, seriously, what's with you people I'm blind!"
"5132" "Katara" "  It's a wanted poster of you.  The Runaway.  Is that what you're called now?  Are you proud of this?"
"5133" "Toph" "  Where did you get that? !"
"5134" "Katara" "  It doesn't matter where I got it.  The fact is. . ."
"5135" "Toph" "  You went through my stuff!  You had no right."
"5136" "Katara" "  Your stuff was messy, and I was just straightening up and I happened to stumble across it."
"5137" "Toph" "  That's a lie!  You're lying, Katara."
"5138" "Katara" "  Fine!  It's a lie.  But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up.  I knew you were hiding something, and you were.   Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!"
"5139" "Toph" "  Oh, really, Mom?  Or what are you going to do?  Send me to my room?"
"5140" "Katara" "  I wish I could."
"5141" "Toph" "  Well, you can't.  Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom."
"5142" "Katara" "  I never said I was!"
"5143" "Toph" "  No, but you certainly act like it.  You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not.  You're just a regular kid like the rest of us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do.  I can do whatever I want!"
"5144" "Katara" "   I don't act that way.   Sokka, do I act motherly?"
"5145" "Sokka" "  Hey -  I'm staying out of this one."
"5146" "Katara" "  What do you think, Aang?  Do I act like a mom?"
"5147" "Aang" "   Well, I. . ."
"5148" "Katara" "  Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!"
"5149" "Aang" "   Yes, ma'am."
"5150" "Toph" "  I can't be around you right now!"
"5151" "Katara" "  Well, I can't be around you!"
"5152" "Sokka" "  I know, Hawky.  Why can't they just get along?"
"5153" "Sokka" "  Hey, Aang, you want to test out my messenger hawk with me?  I've got an idea."
"5154" "Aang" "  Sure."
"5155" "Sokka" "  I'm gonna send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize.  Then everyone will be friends again."
"5156" "Aang" "  I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas."
"5157" "Sokka" "  Eh, it's a gift.   Dear Katara.  Sorry for everything.  Your friend, Toph."
"5158" "Katara" "  I know this is from you, Sokka.  Toph can't write.  Ugh, you're all driving me crazy!"
"5159" "Aang" "  I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write."
"5160" "Sokka" "  Yep, we're idiots."
"5161" "Aang" "  I guess plan B is, we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara."
"5162" "Sokka" "  I think we're gonna run into a similar problem.  Sorry, Hawky.  Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.   Come on, we need to talk."
"5163" "Toph" "  So let me guess.  You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be."
"5164" "Sokka" "  Nah, she's pretty much a pain.   She's always got to be right about everything, and she gets all bossy, and involved, and in your business."
"5165" "Toph" "  Yeah, I don't know how you can deal with it."
"5166" "Sokka" "  Actually, in a way, I rely on it."
"5167" "Toph" "  I don't understand."
"5168" "Sokka" "  When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life.  Our family was a mess, but Katara, she had so much strength.  She stepped up and took on so much responsibility.  She helped fill the void that was left by our mom."
"5169" "Toph" "  I guess I never thought about that."
"5170" "Sokka" "  I'm gonna tell you something crazy.  I never told anyone this before, but honestly, I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like.  It really seems like, my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me.  She's always been the one that's there, and now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture."
"5171" "Toph" "  The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing.  She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me.  You know, the real me.  That's more than my own mom.    Don't ever tell her I said any of this."
"5172" "Sokka" "  Hey, my lips are sealed."
"5173" "Katara" "  Hi, Toph.  Um, I want to. . ."
"5174" "Toph" "  Katara, stop.  You don't need to apologize.  I was the one being stupid.  These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them."
"5175" "Katara" "   Actually, I wasn't going to apologize.  I was gonna say. . .  I want to pull a scam with you!"
"5176" "Toph" "  What?  You want to pull a scam?"
"5177" "Katara" "  Not just any scam. . . the ultimate scam!   What do you say, Toph?  Just me and you. . .  one last go.  You in?"
"5178" "Toph" "  You know I'm in!  Now what's this idea of yours?"
"5179" "Toph" "  How could you do this to me?  You betrayed me."
"5180" "Katara" "  You brought this on yourself.  I had no choice."
"5181" "Katara" "   The right thing is its own reward."
"5182" "Katara" "   But. . .  I still want the actual reward."
"5183" "Toph" "   Hey, what kind of cell is this?"
"5184" "Aang" "  Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?"
"5185" "Sokka" "  I was just wondering the same thing.  We'd better check it out.     You two behave.  Appa's in charge."
"5186" "Toph" "  Wait.  It's a trap!"
"5187" "Katara" "  Really?  No kidding.  Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now?  Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?"
"5188" "Toph" "  Not for us, Katara.  We're the bait.  He wants Aang."
"5189" "Katara" "  I can't believe I was so stupid.  See, this is exactly why I'm against these scams.  I knew this would happen."
"5190" "Toph" "  But. . . this was your idea."
"5191" "Katara" "  I know.  I wanted to show you that I'm not so motherly.  I wanted to show you that I can have fun too."
"5192" "Toph" "  Katara, you are fun.  If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with."
"5193" "Katara" "  I know your relationship with your parents is complicated, and I shouldn't have said what I said."
"5194" "Toph" "  It's ok.  I was really mad when you said that because; well, because maybe it's true.  I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them."
"5195" "Sokka" "  Where do you think they might be?"
"5196" "Aang" "  Where do you think anyone is?    Sokka, watch out!    It's Sparky- Sparky Boom Man!"
"5197" "Sokka" "  You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit."
"5198" "Katara" "  What are we gonna do?"
"5199" "Toph" "  I don't know!  I wish we had some earth or water.  We need bendables!"
"5200" "Katara" "  What about your meteor bracelet?  You could make a saw."
"5201" "Toph" "  I left it back at camp.  I was worried they would take it.   Um, Katara. . . are you ok?"
"5202" "Katara" "  Just fine."
"5203" "Toph" "  Well, what are you doing?"
"5204" "Katara" "  I'm making my own water!"
"5205" "Toph" "  Katara, you're a genius!  A sweaty, stinky genius!"
"5206" "Sokka" "  This guy is too good.  He shoots fire from his brain!"
"5207" "Aang" "  We should split up.  He can't chase us both."
"5208" "Katara" "  Aang, get up!"
"5209" "Toph" "  Let's get out of here."
"5210" "Sokka" "  Hey, I got it.  The perfect name for that guy!  Combustion Man!"
"5211" "Toph" "  Good job, Sokka.  Now let's get out of here before Combustion Man catches us!"
"5212" "Sokka" "  See?  It fits so well."
"5213" "Sokka" "  Well, I'm exhausted.  Hawky, how about you, buddy?   Yeah, you're such a lazy little bird."
"5214" "Toph" "  Katara, I need your help."
"5215" "Katara" "  What is it, Toph?"
"5216" "Toph" "  I need you to write some things down for me.  I want to send a letter to my parents."
"5217" "Katara" "  I'll be happy to help."
"5218" "Sokka" "  Hey, where'd Hawky go?"
"5219" "Sokka" "  Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark.  Oooh. . .  It came into the torchlight.  And they knew the blade of Wing -  Fun was haunted!  Aah- ah. . ."
"5220" "Aang" "  I think I liked the man with a sword for a hand better."
"5221" "Toph" "  Water Tribe slumber parties must stink."
"5222" "Katara" "  No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story."
"5223" "Sokka" "  Is this one of those a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to stories?"
"5224" "Katara" "  No, it happened to Mom.   One winter, when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks.  A month later, Mom realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm.  So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family.  When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace.  While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house.  When she was alone, she heard a voice,  It's so cold and I can't get warm.  Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire.  She was blue, like she was frozen.  Mom ran outside for help, but. . .  when every one came back, Nini was gone."
"5225" "Sokka" "  Where'd she go?"
"5226" "Katara" "  No one knows.  Nini's house stands empty to this day.  But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm."
"5227" "Toph" "  Wait.  Guys, did you hear that?  I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming."
"5228" "Sokka" "  Pft, nice try."
"5229" "Toph" "  No, I'm serious, I hear something."
"5230" "Katara" "  You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories."
"5231" "Toph" "  It just stopped."
"5232" "Aang" "  All right, now I'm getting scared."
"5233" "Sokka" "  Yes, please."
"5234" "Katara" "  Thanks for letting us stay here tonight.  You have a lovely inn."
"5235" "Sokka" "  What do you mean, disappearing?"
"5236" "Sokka" "  I know Momo, this place is creepy.  I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep."
"5237" "Katara" "  That Mr.  Yao seems to have a thing for you.  Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages."
"5238" "Sokka" "  This is a mysterious little town you have here ."
"5239" "Sokka" "  That Hama seems a little strange.  Like she knows something, or she's hiding something."
"5240" "Katara" "  That's ridiculous.  She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay.  She kind of reminds me of Gran- Gran."
"5241" "Sokka" "  But what did she mean by that comment, mysterious children?"
"5242" "Katara" "   Gee, I don't know.  Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night?  Isn't that a little mysterious?"
"5243" "Sokka" "  I'm gonna take a look around."
"5244" "Katara" "  Sokka!  Sokka, what are you doing?  You can't just snoop around someone's house."
"5245" "Sokka" "  It'll be fine."
"5246" "Aang" " She could be home any minute."
"5247" "Katara" "   Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude."
"5248" "Sokka" "  I'm not finished yet.   Come on. . ."
"5249" "Aang" "  Ok, that's pretty creepy."
"5250" "Katara" "   So. . .  she's got a hobby.  There's nothing weird about that.  Sokka, you've looked enough.  Hama will be back soon."
"5251" "Sokka" "  Just an ordinary, puppet- loving innkeeper, huh?  Then why does she have a locked door up here?"
"5252" "Katara" "   Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff."
"5253" "Sokka" "  We'll see.   It's empty except for a little chest."
"5254" "Toph" "   Maybe it's treasure."
"5255" "Katara" "  Sokka, what are you doing?  You're breaking into a private room."
"5256" "Sokka" "  I have to see what's in there."
"5257" "Aang" "  We shouldn't be doing this."
"5258" "Sokka" "  Maybe there's a key here somewhere."
"5259" "Toph" "  Oh, hand it over."
"5260" "Sokka" "  Come on, come on!"
"5261" "Toph" "  This isn't as easy it looks."
"5262" "Aang" "   Guys, I don't know about this."
"5263" "Katara" "  This is crazy, I'm leaving."
"5264" "Sokka" "  Suit yourself.  Do it, Toph."
"5265" "Sokka" "   An old comb?"
"5266" "Katara" "  You're from the Southern Water Tribe?"
"5267" "Katara" "  How did you know?"
"5268" "Sokka" "  But why didn't you tell us?"
"5269" "Aang" "   Great."
"5270" "Katara" "  I knew I felt a bond with you right away."
"5271" "Sokka" "  And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.   But I'm sorry we were sneaking around."
"5272" "Aang" "  I'd steer clear of the sea prunes."
"5273" "Toph" "  I thought they were ocean kumquats."
"5274" "Aang" "  Close enough."
"5275" "Katara" "  You're a Waterbender!  I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe."
"5276" "Sokka" "  So how did you end up out here?"
"5277" "Sokka" "  How did you get away?  And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?"
"5278" "Katara" "  We completely understand.  We lost our mother in a raid."
"5279" "Katara" "  I can't tell you what it means to meet you.  It's an honor, you're a hero."
"5280" "Katara" "   Yes, yes of course!  To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me."
"5281" "Katara" "  I know, when we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do."
"5282" "Katara" "  I've even used my own sweat for waterbending."
"5283" "Aang" "  This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the Fire Nation.  I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here."
"5284" "Toph" "  Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean."
"5285" "Sokka" "   The moon spirit is a gentle, loving lady.  She rules the sky with compassion and. . .  lunar goodness."
"5286" "Aang" "  Excuse me, sir.  Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?"
"5287" "Toph" "  Where does Old Man Ding live?"
"5288" "Katara" "  Wow, these flowers are beautiful."
"5289" "Katara" "  I met a Waterbender who lived in a swamp, and could control the vines by bending the water inside."
"5290" "Katara" "  That was incredible.   It's a shame about the lilies, though."
"5291" "Katara" "  But isn't that dangerous?  I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon."
"5292" "Aang" "   Old Man Ding?"
"5293" "Sokka" "   We wanted to ask you about that."
"5294" "Aang" "  Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?"
"5295" "Sokka" "  Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?"
"5296" "Toph" "  Oh, no!   I did hear people screaming under the mountain.  The missing villagers must still be there."
"5297" "Toph" "  This is the place."
"5298" "Sokka" "  I can't see anything down there."
"5299" "Toph" "   That's why you have me, let's go."
"5300" "Aang" "  I didn't know that spirits made prisons like this, who brought you here?"
"5301" "Sokka" "  A witch, what do you mean?"
"5302" "Sokka" "   Hama!"
"5303" "Sokka" "  I knew there was something creepy about her."
"5304" "Aang" "  We have to stop Hama!"
"5305" "Toph" "  I'll get these people out of here, you go."
"5306" "Katara" "   But, to reach inside someone and control them?  I don't know if I want that kind of power."
"5307" "Katara" "  I know."
"5308" "Katara" "  It's you.  You're the one who's making people disappear during the full moons."
"5309" "Katara" "   I won't!  I won't use bloodbending, and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town."
"5310" "Katara" "  Stop. . . please."
"5311" "Katara" "  You're not the only one who draws power from the moon.  My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama.  Your technique is useless on me!"
"5312" "Sokka" "  We know what you've been doing, Hama!"
"5313" "Aang" "  Give up, you're outnumbered."
"5314" "Sokka" "  Katara, look out!  It's like my brain has a mind of its own.  Stop it, arm, stop it!"
"5315" "Aang" "  This feels weird."
"5316" "Katara" "  I'm sorry, Aang."
"5317" "Aang" "   It's ok."
"5318" "Katara" "  No!"
"5319" "Sokka" "   This is it, the official rendezvous point for the invasion force."
"5320" "Toph" "  How did you pick this place?"
"5321" "Sokka" "  Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map.  It'suninhabited, and the harbor  surrounded by cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place."
"5322" "Katara" "   Nice choice Sokka.  And we're here four days ahead of schedule."
"5323" "Aang" "   Wait,  four days!   The invasion's in four days!"
"5324" "Sokka" "   Whatever.   That's like. . .  four days from now.   Let's just calm down, and . . ."
"5325" "Katara" "  Sokka's got the right idea Aang.  We're here, we're ready. . .   the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest."
"5326" "Aang" "  Uh. .   I guess."
"5327" "Aang" "   Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord.  I'm bringing you down!"
"5328" "Aang" "   Uah!   It was just a dream Momo, I still have my pants.   Well, I better keep training."
"5329" "Zuko" "  I'm just going to Mai's house, it's not far."
"5330" "Katara" "  Hey, how long have you been up?"
"5331" "Aang" "  A couple hours.   I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm going to fight Ozai."
"5332" "Katara" "   You know there is such a thing as over- training."
"5333" "Aang" "  You don't get it, do you?   My form is bad.  I'm sloppy.  And I still don't know any firebending, not even the basics."
"5334" "Sokka" "  That's okay Aang.  The eclipse will block all firebending anyway, you don't need to know any.   Plus it's a stupid element."
"5335" "Aang" "  Okay,  well, I still have to work on everything else.  I'd better spend the whole day training."
"5336" "Aang" "   Good night Katara.  Good night Sokka.  Good night Toph.  Good night Appa.  Good night Momo.  Good night Appa and Momo."
"5337" "Toph" "   Go to sleep already!"
"5338" "Aang" "   Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord.  I'm bringing you down. . .  and this time I brought pants."
"5339" "Aang" "   Math test? !  Oh no!   I forgot all about the math test!   I've got to be ready!"
"5340" "Katara" "  Aang, it's the middle of the night.  You need to go back to sleep."
"5341" "Aang" "   But I forgot my pants and my math test."
"5342" "Katara" "   Aang, sleep.  Please. . . for me."
"5343" "Zuko" "  Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would it be?"
"5344" "Zuko" "   You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen."
"5345" "Zuko" "  Do you think  you can find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top."
"5346" "Zuko" "   War meeting?  What are you talking about?"
"5347" "Zuko" "   I guess I wasn't invited."
"5348" "Aang" "  Sokka get up!  I need to know what day it is!"
"5349" "Sokka" "  What? !   Who's talking? !"
"5350" "Toph" "   Relax, it's still two days before the invasion."
"5351" "Aang" "   Sokka, you've got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises."
"5352" "Sokka" "  What?"
"5353" "Aang" "   In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you  were too slow and they got you."
"5354" "Sokka" "  But that was just a dream,  I'm a great climber."
"5355" "Aang" "   Then climb that cliff.  Climb it fast!"
"5356" "Sokka" "   Stupid Avatar.  Stupid cliff.  Stupid dream!  I can climb fast!"
"5357" "Aang" "   Don't drink that!"
"5358" "Toph" "   Why, is it poisoned?"
"5359" "Aang" "  In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom.  We died because of your tiny bladder.   And you  need to start wearing your hair up.   In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and. . ."
"5360" "Katara" "   Aang, I know you're just trying to help.  But you really need to get a grip.  You're unraveling."
"5361" "Aang" "  You're right.  I'm losing my mind."
"5362" "Sokka" "  Ahhh!"
"5363" "Aang" "  It's like every time I think about how stressed I am,  I just end up more stressed.   I'm like a big, growing snowball of nerves."
"5364" "Sokka" "   Of course you are.  That's 'cause you've got to fight the Fire Lord,  the baddest man on the planet.  And you better win, or we're all done for."
"5365" "Katara" "  Sokka, you're not helping!"
"5366" "Sokka" "   What?  It's true.  That's the deal, he knows it."
"5367" "Katara" "  You know what?  I've got just the thing.   Get ready to be de- stress- i- fied.   These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat.  Reach up.   Reach for the sun.   Feel your chi paths clearing.   Now close your eyes.  How are you feeling?"
"5368" "Aang" "   I feel. . . really warm."
"5369" "Katara" "  Good, good.  Go on."
"5370" "Aang" "  Like there's the warm feeling all around me.  This heat. . .  like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace, and he's shooting a bunch of fire balls at me.  And the whole world is being engulfed in flames."
"5371" "Katara" "  Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out."
"5372" "Sokka" "   Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you."
"5373" "Aang" "   You know what's bothering me.  I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days."
"5374" "Sokka" "  Mhm.   Tell me more about this, 'Fire Lord. ' Why are you so afraid of him?"
"5375" "Aang" "   You said it yourself.  He's the baddest man on the planet.  I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world."
"5376" "Sokka" "  Hmm.   Life does feel that way some times, doesn't it?   Like we're all trying to save the world from evil."
"5377" "Aang" "  Okay, but what can I do to feel better?"
"5378" "Sokka" "  Want to try screaming into this pillow?"
"5379" "Zuko" "  So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh.  And apparently I'm not welcome there."
"5380" "Zuko" "   Oh yeah?  I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it."
"5381" "Zuko" "   Well, were you invited?"
"5382" "Zuko" "   And I'm the Prince!"
"5383" "Zuko" "  Forget it, I'm not going."
"5384" "Toph" "  Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin' to relieve your stress."
"5385" "Aang" "  Pound away.   Ahh!  Ow!  Uh!  Toph!   I . . .  think . . .  this . . .  is . . .  bruising . . .  me!"
"5386" "Toph" "  Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin.   Well, there's one other thing we can try. . .   acupuncture!"
"5387" "Aang" "   Ahhhh!"
"5388" "Zuko" "  I don't."
"5389" "Zuko" "  I know."
"5390" "Aang" "  Thanks for everything guys."
"5391" "Katara" "   So do you feel less stressed?  Ready for a good night sleep?"
"5392" "Aang" "   Uhh. . . I kinda think I sorta might . . .  slightly feel a little better . . .  maybe."
"5393" "Sokka" "   Then our work here is done."
"5394" "Katara" "   What happened Aang?"
"5395" "Aang" "   It's the nightmares.  They just get worse and worse."
"5396" "Sokka" "   Looks like it's time for. . .   another therapy session."
"5397" "Aang" "   No, that won't help.  Nothing helps.   There's only one thing I can do.  I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion."
"5398" "Katara" "  You don't look so good.   You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?"
"5399" "Aang" "   I told you, I can't go back to sleep."
"5400" "Katara" "  Aang, staying up can't be good for you."
"5401" "Aang" "  Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think.   And I've realized some big things Katara."
"5402" "Katara" "   What big things?"
"5403" "Aang" "   I see everything so clearly now. . .  what really matters.  Why I'm really doing this.  I'm doing it to save the world,  but more than that.  I'm doing it for the people I love.   I'm doing it for you Katara."
"5404" "Katara" "  Aang, what are you saying?"
"5405" "Aang" "  I'm saying. . . I love you."
"5406" "Katara" "  What are we doing?"
"5407" "Aang" "  What our hearts  have been telling us to do for a long, long time.  Baby,  you're my forever girl."
"5408" "Katara" "  Aang?"
"5409" "Aang" "  Huh?"
"5410" "Katara" "  I was just saying you should take a nap."
"5411" "Aang" "  Oh,  I guess I kinda drifted off into a day- dream."
"5412" "Katara" "  What was your dream about?"
"5413" "Aang" "   Uhh, living under water?"
"5414" "Katara" "   Sounds neat."
"5415" "Aang" "   Heh.  Phew."
"5416" "Zuko" "   What?"
"5417" "Zuko" "   So, my dad wants me at the meeting?"
"5418" "Aang" "  Put 'em up, Fire Lord."
"5419" "Sokka" "  Hey, I'm trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked.  He's your bison . . ."
"5420" "Aang" "   Ozai's defense is impeccable.  I'll have to try a different approach.   You think you're untouchable, don't you Mr.  Fire Lord."
"5421" "Aang" "  Momo, did you hear something."
"5422" "Aang" "  Uhh."
"5423" "Aang" "  That's more like it.   I'm so tired, that for a second there I imagined you were talking to me.   Oh, Momo. . .  let me explain."
"5424" "Katara" "  Aang  We're all starting to get a little worried about you."
"5425" "Sokka" "   You've been awake too long."
"5426" "Toph" "   And you're acting downright weird."
"5427" "Aang" "  Uhh.   I appreciate what you guys are saying.  But the stress and the nightmares, they were too much.  Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it."
"5428" "Aang" "  Guys. . . come on."
"5429" "Sokka" "  About what?"
"5430" "Aang" "  About that!"
"5431" "Aang" "  Come on guys,   we're all on the same side!"
"5432" "Aang" "  Huh?  Huh!"
"5433" "Aang" "   I just need a jump in a cold waterfall."
"5434" "Zuko" "  When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.    My father had saved me a seat.  He wanted me next to him.   I was literally at his right hand."
"5435" "Zuko" "  During the meeting, I was the perfect prince.   The son my father wanted.  But I wasn't me."
"5436" "Aang" "  Oh look, another hallucination.  An imaginary bed, made out of clouds."
"5437" "Toph" "  Hey!  It's real!  We spent hours working on it."
"5438" "Sokka" "  We made it for you.   A good night sleep will probably take the crazy away. . .  we hope."
"5439" "Aang" "  Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can't, the invasion's tomorrow."
"5440" "Katara" "   Aang. . ."
"5441" "Aang" "   No Katara, there's still so much I haven't learned.  I don't need sleep.  What I need is practice.  Quick, hit me."
"5442" "Katara" "  I'm not going to hit you."
"5443" "Toph" "  You want me to do it?"
"5444" "Katara" "  Listen to me,  you've been training for this since the day we've met.  I've seen your progress.  You're smart, brave, and strong enough."
"5445" "Aang" "   You really think so?"
"5446" "Sokka" "   We all do.  You can do this.  You're ready."
"5447" "Toph" "  You're the man,  Twinkle- toes."
"5448" "Aang" "  Thanks guys.   You know what?  I think I am ready."
"5449" "Aang" "   Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord."
"5450" "Aang" "   No Fire Lord Ozai,  you're not wearing pants."
"5451" "Aang" "   Top of the morning, Momo!"
"5452" "Katara" "  Sounds like you slept well."
"5453" "Aang" "  Like a baby mooselion.  I'm ready  to face the Fire Lord."
"5454" "Toph" "  So what's your strategy for taking him down?  Going to get your glow on  and hit him  with a little Avatar State action?"
"5455" "Aang" "  I can't.  When Azula shot me with lightning, my 7th chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the Universe."
"5456" "Toph" "  You know what I just?  heard Blah blah spiritual mumbo jumbo blah blah something about Space."
"5457" "Katara" "  Oh no.  Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?"
"5458" "Sokka" "  No, that is the invasion."
"5459" "Katara" "  You made it Dad!"
"5460" "Sokka" "  Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?"
"5461" "Katara" "  Haru,  it's so good to see you."
"5462" "Aang" "   Toph, this is Haru.  When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation.  So we had to hide his earthbending."
"5463" "Toph" "  No way.   Is that. . ."
"5464" "Toph" "   You guys here for a re- match?"
"5465" "Toph" "  Sweet."
"5466" "Sokka" "  Was that a new invention?"
"5467" "Sokka" "  You're making peanut sauce bombs?"
"5468" "Sokka" "  Were you able to complete work on the plans I sent you?"
"5469" "Aang" "   A new glider!  This is amazing."
"5470" "Aang" "  Oh well, I'm sure that will come in handy."
"5471" "Iroh" "  Thank you, Ming.   Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me."
"5472" "Sokka" "  Good morning, everyone!"
"5473" "Sokka" "  Uhm. . .  So, as you know today we're invading the Fire Nation.  I mean I know you know that.   Because otherwise why else would you be here Anyway. . .   The Fire Lord's palace is here.   Uh no, uh wait,  uh wait , uh wait .  It's here  and uh there's an eclipse today and Aang's going to fight the Fire Lord  and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us and uhm. . .   I'm sorry, let me start at the beginning."
"5474" "Sokka" "   Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg.  Now I didn't like Aang at first but I grew to love him over time.  Then we went over to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and thenwe met Suki, who is a Kyoshi warrior."
"5475" "Sokka" "  . . . and then Aang's friend was a crazy old man and then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache  and if you look in the front row you can see him. . ."
"5476" "Aang" "  We've been looking everywhere for you.  The boats are ready to leave."
"5477" "Sokka" "   I messed up, Aang."
"5478" "Aang" "  What?"
"5479" "Sokka" "  The invasion plan was my moment of truth.  And I completely flopped it.  I just fell apart."
"5480" "Aang" "  Sokka,  that speech wasn't your moment of truth.  That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that."
"5481" "Sokka" "  My Dad is.  He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone.  Like a real leader should."
"5482" "Aang" "  Look, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map.  It's going to be out there,  on the battlefield."
"5483" "Sokka" "  You seem so confident about everything.  How do you know we're going to win?"
"5484" "Aang" "  Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se.  I won't let myself fail again."
"5485" "Katara" "   I don't see any gates."
"5486" "Toph" "   Yeah.  Congratulations, Sokka.   You managed to invent a worst way of travel than flying."
"5487" "Sokka" "  Well, I just came up with the idea but The Mechanist did all the work."
"5488" "Iroh" "  Thank you, Ming.  Your little gestures of kindness had made my days in prison bearable.   I think you should take the rest of the day off."
"5489" "Iroh" "  You don't look well.   Maybe you should go home and rest."
"5490" "Iroh" "  Trust me.   It is better that you are not here this afternoon."
"5491" "Aang" "  So, this is it huh?"
"5492" "Sokka" "  Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar's alive?"
"5493" "Aang" "  I'm ready."
"5494" "Toph" "   I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, twinkle toes."
"5495" "Katara" "  Aang, I."
"5496" "Aang" "  Katara, I."
"5497" "Aang" "  You go first."
"5498" "Katara" "  We've been through so many things together and I've seen you grow up so much.  You're not that little goofy kid  I found in the iceberg anymore.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you."
"5499" "Aang" "  Everything is going to be different after today, isn't it?"
"5500" "Katara" "  Yes, it is."
"5501" "Aang" "   What if. . .  what if I don't come back?"
"5502" "Katara" "  Aang, don't say that.  Of course you'll. . ."
"5503" "Sokka" "   Katara, what are you doing?  It's time to submerge."
"5504" "Katara" "   What?  Right, I'm on it."
"5505" "Zuko" "  I'm sorry, Mai."
"5506" "Aang" "  What did you know?  It did come in handy."
"5507" "Sokka" "  Dad, look out!"
"5508" "Sokka" "   I've got an idea."
"5509" "Katara" "  Dad?"
"5510" "Sokka" "  Dad!"
"5511" "Zuko" "  I know I made some bad choices.  But today, I'm going to set things right."
"5512" "Katara" "  How does that feel, Dad?"
"5513" "Katara" "  You're hurt.  Badly.  You can't fight anymore."
"5514" "Sokka" "  Can't you heal him any faster?"
"5515" "Katara" "  I'm doing everything I can."
"5516" "Sokka" "  I'll do it."
"5517" "Katara" "  No offense Sokka but you're not exactly Mr.  Healing Hands."
"5518" "Sokka" "  No.   I'll lead the invasion force."
"5519" "Katara" "  Don't be crazy, Sokka."
"5520" "Sokka" "  Maybe I am a little crazy but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano  by the time it does."
"5521" "Katara" "  I still think you're crazy but I'm proud of you too."
"5522" "Sokka" "  Yip yip."
"5523" "Sokka" "   Listen up everyone,  I want the tanks in wedge formation!   Warriors and benders in the middle.   We're taking that tower  and headed for the royal palace!"
"5524" "Sokka" "   Charge!"
"5525" "Aang" "  That's strange."
"5526" "Aang" "  The Avatar is back!"
"5527" "Aang" "  Hello?   Anyone home?"
"5528" "Aang" "  No. . .   No, no,  NO!  Fire Lord Ozai,  where are you? !  "
"5529" "Sokka" "  Dad!  You're on your feet again."
"5530" "Sokka" "  Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet."
"5531" "Katara" "  Yeah. . .  Is that. . .  is that Aang?"
"5532" "Sokka" "  What?"
"5533" "Sokka" "  Please tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down?"
"5534" "Aang" "  He wasn't home.  No one was.  The entire palace city is abandoned."
"5535" "Sokka" "  They knew."
"5536" "Aang" "  It's over.  The Fire Lord is probably long gone.  Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse."
"5537" "Sokka" "  No.  My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far.  He would have a secret bunker.  Somewhere he could go so it'll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation."
"5538" "Toph" "  If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it."
"5539" "Sokka" "  The Mechanist gave me this timing device.  It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse.  10 minutes to find the Fire Lord."
"5540" "Aang" "  We can still do this.  We can still win the day."
"5541" "Katara" "  Wait.  If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap.  Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely."
"5542" "Sokka" "  What do you think?  You're the one who has to face the Fire Lord.  Whatever you decide, I'm with you."
"5543" "Aang" "  I've got to try."
"5544" "Aang" "  Do you feel anything down there?"
"5545" "Toph" "   Yep.  There are natural tunnels criss- crossing through the inside of the volcano."
"5546" "Sokka" "  Anything else?  Is there a structure somewhere?"
"5547" "Toph" "   There's something big, dense, and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano."
"5548" "Sokka" "  Sounds like a secret bunker to me."
"5549" "Aang" "  Stay safe.  We'll be back soon."
"5550" "Toph" "  This way!  That one's a dead end."
"5551" "Sokka" "  What would we do without you?"
"5552" "Toph" "  Perish and burn in hot magma."
"5553" "Sokka" "  Yeah, pretty much."
"5554" "Toph" "  The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker."
"5555" "Sokka" "  We'll have to be fast but careful."
"5556" "Aang" "  How was that careful?"
"5557" "Sokka" "  I was wrong.  We need to be fast, careful and lucky."
"5558" "Sokka" "  There's no floor!  It's just a river of lava."
"5559" "Aang" "  Climb aboard and hold on tight."
"5560" "Sokka" "  That's some door!"
"5561" "Toph" "  Not a problem."
"5562" "Sokka" "  I am so glad we added you to the group."
"5563" "Katara" "  We can wait here if you want."
"5564" "Aang" "   Thanks."
"5565" "Sokka" "  Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse."
"5566" "Aang" "  I'm ready.  I'm ready to face the Fire Lord."
"5567" "Zuko" "  I'm ready to face you."
"5568" "Zuko" "  I'm here to tell the truth."
"5569" "Zuko" "  First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me."
"5570" "Zuko" "  Because the Avatar is not dead.  He survived."
"5571" "Zuko" "  In fact, he probably is leading this invasion.  He could be on us right now."
"5572" "Zuko" "  That's another thing.  I'm not taking orders from you anymore."
"5573" "Zuko" "  Think again!  I am going to speak my mind and you are going to listen."
"5574" "Aang" "  Where is he?  Where is the Fire Lord?"
"5575" "Sokka" "   Stop wasting our time and give us the information.  You're powerless right now so you're in no position to refuse."
"5576" "Toph" "  And stick to the truth.  I'll be able to tell if you're lying."
"5577" "Toph" "   Okay you're good, I admit it.    But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway."
"5578" "Katara" "  It's not over yet."
"5579" "Zuko" "  For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me.  I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you.  You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.   My father, who challenged me; a 13- year- old boy to an Agni Kai.  How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?"
"5580" "Zuko" "  It was cruel!  And it was wrong."
"5581" "Zuko" "  No, I've learnt everything!  And I had to learn it on my own.  Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world.  What an amazing lie that was.  The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation!  They don't see our greatness, they hate us!  And we deserve it.  We've created an era of fear in the world.  And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness."
"5582" "Zuko" "   Yes.  He has."
"5583" "Aang" "  I can't pin her down.  She's too quick."
"5584" "Sokka" "  Wait!  Aang, Toph, stop attacking.   Don't you see what she's doing?  She's just playing with us.  She's not even trying to win this fight!"
"5585" "Toph" "  You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!"
"5586" "Toph" "  I 'll roll your whole head!"
"5587" "Sokka" "  She's just baiting you again."
"5588" "Aang" "  Okay, so what do we do?  Just ignore her?"
"5589" "Sokka" "  We don't have a choice.  We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow."
"5590" "Sokka" "   Ignore!"
"5591" "Sokka" "  Where is Suki? !"
"5592" "Zuko" "  After I leave here today, I'm going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness.  He is the one who has been a real father to me."
"5593" "Zuko" "  But I've come to an even more important decision.   Really?  Since you're a full blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait?  I'm powerless, you've got yourswords, why don't you just do it now?"
"5594" "Zuko" "  Because I know my own destiny.  Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.   Goodbye."
"5595" "Sokka" "   Where's Suki? !  Answer me!"
"5596" "Aang" "   Sokka, she won't talk."
"5597" "Sokka" "   Where are you keeping her? !"
"5598" "Zuko" "   So she's alive."
"5599" "Sokka" "  I fell for it!  I used up all our time."
"5600" "Toph" "  It's not your fault, Sokka.  Azula was ready for us.  She had every move planned out."
"5601" "Sokka" "   And now it's too late."
"5602" "Aang" "  Maybe it's not too late.  The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway."
"5603" "Sokka" "  No.  I don't think that's a good idea."
"5604" "Aang" "  But I'm ready!  I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me."
"5605" "Toph" "  The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time.  We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't.  It just wasn't our day.  What we need to do now is go help our friends."
"5606" "Aang" "  I guess you guys are right."
"5607" "Sokka" "   You'll have another chance.  I know you will."
"5608" "Katara" "  They're back!"
"5609" "Sokka" "  It was all a trap.  Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move.  We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.  If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely."
"5610" "Aang" "   They've got air power, but so do I!   I'm going to do what I can to slow them down."
"5611" "Katara" "  Appa, you and I can help too."
"5612" "Sokka" "  Everyone, let's get back to the subs!"
"5613" "Katara" "  We can't keep them all back.  They're too many of them!"
"5614" "Aang" "  Let's join the others."
"5615" "Zuko" "  Uncle!"
"5616" "Zuko" "  Where is my Uncle?"
"5617" "Sokka" "  Try and find cover!  I think we're about to see some bombs."
"5618" "Katara" "  Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?"
"5619" "Aang" "  They're headed for the beach.  They're going to destroy the submarines!"
"5620" "Sokka" "  How are we all going to escape?"
"5621" "Sokka" "  Then our only choice is to stand and fight.  We have the Avatar, we could still win!"
"5622" "Katara" "  What?  We can't leave you behind.  We won't leave anyone behind."
"5623" "Sokka" "  They're at the beach already!"
"5624" "Katara" "  We'll miss you Dad."
"5625" "Sokka" "  Bye Dad.  We won't be apart for too long this time.  I promise."
"5626" "Aang" "  Thank you all for being so brave and so strong.  I'm going to make this up to you."
"5627" "Aang" "  I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while.  The Western Air Temple. "
"5628" "Katara" "  This is humiliating."
"5629" "Sokka" "  Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation,  or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?"
"5630" "Katara" "   Both."
"5631" "Aang" "  Sorry guys, but Appa  gets tired carrying all these people."
"5632" "Sokka" "  I miss not having blisters  on my feet."
"5633" "Toph" "  Hey, we're here.  I can feel it."
"5634" "Katara" "  Uh, I think your feet need their eyes checked."
"5635" "Aang" "   No,  she's right,  we are here."
"5636" "Toph" "  Wow,  it's amazing."
"5637" "Iroh" "   What a stunning view."
"5638" "Zuko" "  The only view I'm interested in seeing  is the Avatar in chains."
"5639" "Iroh" "   You know,  the Avatar hasn't been seen for a 100 years.   The chances of finding him here are very slim."
"5640" "Zuko" "  First, we'll check each of the air temples.   Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him."
"5641" "Iroh" "   Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.   You should take some time to heal and rest."
"5642" "Zuko" "   What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the Fire Nation?   The only way  to regain my honor is to find the Avatar.  So I will."
"5643" "Katara" "  You guys go. . .   I think we need to talk about some things."
"5644" "Aang" "  Why can't I go?"
"5645" "Katara" "   We need to decide what we're gonna do now.  And since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this."
"5646" "Aang" "  Fair enough.  So, what's the new plan?"
"5647" "Sokka" "  Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan.  You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes."
"5648" "Aang" "   Oh, yeah, that's great.   No problem,  I'll just do that."
"5649" "Katara" "  Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy."
"5650" "Aang" "   Well, it's not even gonna be possible.  Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?"
"5651" "Katara" "   We could look for Jeong Jeong."
"5652" "Aang" "  Yeah right,  like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again."
"5653" "Toph" "   Who's -  Oh,  never mind.  If it's important, I'll find out."
"5654" "Aang" "  Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody.  Why don't we  just take a nice tour  around the temple?"
"5655" "Toph" "   What's up with him?"
"5656" "Sokka" "  There's got  to be someone who can teach him firebending."
"5657" "Zuko" "  Hello,  Zuko here.  But I guess  you probably already know me. . .  sort of.  Uh. . . so, the thing is,  I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm  considered to be pretty good at it.   Well, you've seen me. . .  you know, when I was attacking you?   Uh, yeah. . . I guess  I should apologize for that.  But anyway,  I'm good now.   I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad.   Ugh, but anyway. . .  I think it's time I joined your group, and taught  the Avatar firebending."
"5658" "Zuko" "   Well, what's your answer? !"
"5659" "Zuko" "  Yeah, that's what I'd say too.   How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side?  What would Uncle do?  Zuko, you have to look within yourself, to save yourself  from your other self.   Only then will your true self reveal itself.   Even when I'm talking for him, I can't figure out what he means.  What would Azula do?  Listen, Avatar, I can join your group  or I can do something unspeakably horrible  to you and your friends.  Your choice.   I guess I'm not that good at impersonations."
"5660" "Katara" "  Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?"
"5661" "Aang" "   What?  The wind is too loud in my ears.  Check out this loop."
"5662" "Sokka" "   Aang,  I think we should be making some plans about our future."
"5663" "Aang" "  Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table.   Oh, you're gonna love the all- day echo chamber."
"5664" "Toph" "   I think that'll have to wait."
"5665" "Zuko" "   Hello,  Zuko here."
"5666" "Zuko" "  Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought  I'd wait for you here."
"5667" "Zuko" "  I know you must be surprised to see me here."
"5668" "Sokka" "  Not really, since you've followed us all over the world."
"5669" "Zuko" "   Right. . .  Well, uh. . .  anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh,  I'm good now.  And, well, I think I should join your group.  Oh, and I can teach firebending. . .  to you.   See, I uh. . ."
"5670" "Toph" "   You want to what now? !"
"5671" "Katara" "  You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you?  I mean, how stupid do you think we are?"
"5672" "Sokka" "  Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down  and capture Aang."
"5673" "Zuko" "   I've done some good things.   I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.   That's something."
"5674" "Toph" "  Appa  does seem to like him."
"5675" "Sokka" "  He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him.  I'm not  buying it."
"5676" "Zuko" "   I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes  in the past."
"5677" "Sokka" "   Like when you attacked our village?"
"5678" "Katara" "   Or when you stole my mother's necklace  and used it to track us down  and capture us?"
"5679" "Zuko" "   Look, I admit I've done some awful things.  I was wrong  to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.   And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.   I'm gonna try to stop him."
"5680" "Sokka" "   Wait, you sent  Combustion Man after us?"
"5681" "Zuko" "   Well, that's not his name, but. . ."
"5682" "Sokka" "   Oh, sorry.   I didn't mean to insult your friend."
"5683" "Zuko" "   He's not my friend! Toph  That guy  locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us  all up."
"5684" "Zuko" "   Why aren't you saying anything?   You once said you thought we could be  friends.   You know I  have good in me."
"5685" "Aang" "  There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.   We'll never let you join us."
"5686" "Katara" "   You need to get out of here, now."
"5687" "Zuko" "   I'm trying to explain  that I'm not that person anymore."
"5688" "Sokka" "  Either you leave, or we attack."
"5689" "Zuko" "   If you won't accept me as a friend,  then maybe you'll take me  as a prisoner."
"5690" "Katara" "   No, we won't!"
"5691" "Katara" "   Get out of here  and don't come back.  And if we ever see you again. . . Well,  we'd better not see you again!"
"5692" "Zuko" "  Argh, I can't believe how stupid  I am.  I mean,  what was I thinking?   Telling them I sent an assassin after them?  Why didn't I just say Azula  did that?  They  would've believed that.  Stupid!"
"5693" "Katara" "  Why would he try to fool us like that?"
"5694" "Sokka" "  Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap."
"5695" "Katara" "  This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se.   He starts talking about his mother,  and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings."
"5696" "Sokka" "  He wants you  to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down, then he strikes."
"5697" "Katara" "   The thing is, it worked.   I did feel sorry for him.  I felt like he was really confused and hurt.   But obviously when the time came,  he made his choice, and we paid the price.   We can't trust him."
"5698" "Aang" "   I kind of  have a confession to make.   Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by  Zhao?"
"5699" "Sokka" "   And you made us suck on frozen frogs?  How could I forget?   I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!"
"5700" "Katara" "   Sokka,  I looked at it and told you there was nothing there."
"5701" "Sokka" "   I could feel it!  It's my throatal flap."
"5702" "Aang" "  Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko  who came in and got me out.   He risked his life to save me."
"5703" "Katara" "  No way,  I'm sure  he only did it  so he could capture you himself."
"5704" "Sokka" "  Yeah,  face it Aang.  You're nothing but a big prize to him."
"5705" "Aang" "  You're probably right."
"5706" "Katara" "  And what was  all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?   What a liar."
"5707" "Toph" " Actually,  he wasn't lying."
"5708" "Sokka" "   Oh, hooray.   In a lifetime of evil, at least  he didn't add animal cruelty to the list."
"5709" "Toph" "   I'm just saying that  considering his messed- up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse."
"5710" "Katara" "  You're right,  Toph, let's go find him  and give him a medal.   The not as much of a jerk as you could have been award."
"5711" "Toph" "   All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere.  Maybe  you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly."
"5712" "Katara" "   Easy for you to say, you weren't there  when he had us attacked by pirates."
"5713" "Sokka" "   Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island."
"5714" "Aang" "  Or when he tried to capture me  at the fire temple."
"5715" "Katara" "  Why would you  even try to defend him?"
"5716" "Toph" "   Because Katara,  you're all ignoring  one crucial fact.  Aang needs  a firebending teacher.  We can't think  of a single person in the world to do the job.   Now one shows up on a silver platter,  and you  won't even think  about it?"
"5717" "Aang" "  I'm not having Zuko as my teacher."
"5718" "Sokka" "  You're darn right  you're not, buddy."
"5719" "Katara" "  Well,  I guess that's settled."
"5720" "Toph" "   I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one  around here."
"5721" "Zuko" "  Who's there?   Stay back."
"5722" "Toph" "   It's me!  style=mso-"
"5723" "Toph" "  You burned my feet!"
"5724" "Zuko" "   I'm sorry, it was a mistake!"
"5725" "Toph" "   Get away  from me!"
"5726" "Zuko" "  Let me  help you.   I'm sorry."
"5727" "Toph" "  Get off me,  get off me!"
"5728" "Zuko" "   I didn't know it was you.   Come back!   Why am I so bad at being good?"
"5729" "Sokka" "  I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday."
"5730" "Katara" "   I think we should go look for her."
"5731" "Sokka" "  Oh, let her have fun with her rocks.  I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again."
"5732" "Katara" "  Toph, what happened?"
"5733" "Toph" "  My feet got burned."
"5734" "Katara" "   Oh, no, what happened?"
"5735" "Toph" "   I just told you, my feet got burned."
"5736" "Katara" "  I meant how."
"5737" "Toph" "  Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night."
"5738" "Aang" "   You what! ?"
"5739" "Katara" "   Zuko?"
"5740" "Sokka" "   Ugh!"
"5741" "Toph" "  I just thought he could be helpful to us.  And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out."
"5742" "Aang" "  So he attacked you?"
"5743" "Toph" "  Well, he did and he didn't.  It was sort of an accident."
"5744" "Aang" "  But he did firebend at you?"
"5745" "Toph" "  Yes."
"5746" "Sokka" "  See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned. . .  literally."
"5747" "Katara" "   It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better.  I wish I could've worked on them sooner."
"5748" "Toph" "  Yeah, me too."
"5749" "Sokka" "  Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone.  We're gonna have to go after him."
"5750" "Aang" "   I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right.  After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice."
"5751" "Sokka" "  He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him."
"5752" "Toph" "   Maybe just invite him back here.  He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once."
"5753" "Sokka" "  Yeah. . .  get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner.  Then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner.  He'll never suspect it."
"5754" "Katara" "  You are a master of surprise, Sokka."
"5755" "Zuko" "   Stop!   I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore."
"5756" "Zuko" "  The mission is off.  I'm ordering you to stop!"
"5757" "Zuko" "  If you keep attacking, I won't pay you!   All right, I'll pay you double to stop!"
"5758" "Toph" "   He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side."
"5759" "Katara" "  I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up.  And I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here."
"5760" "Sokka" "   I know how to get an angle on him."
"5761" "Sokka" "  All right buddy, don't fail me now."
"5762" "Sokka" "   Yeah, boomerang!   Aw, boomerang. . ."
"5763" "Aang" "  I can't believe I'm saying this. . .  but thanks Zuko."
"5764" "Sokka" "  Hey, and what about me?  I did the boomerang thing."
"5765" "Zuko" "   Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday.  I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard.  But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth.  I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me.  But I know now that no one can give you your honor.  It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right.  All I want now is to play my part in ending this war.  And I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world."
"5766" "Zuko" "  I'm sorry for what I did to you.   It was an accident.  Fire can be dangerous and wild.  So as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending so I don't hurt people unintentionally."
"5767" "Aang" "  I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher.  When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara.  And after that, I never wanted to firebend again.  But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.   I'd like you to teach me."
"5768" "Zuko" "  Thank you.  I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group."
"5769" "Aang" "  Not so fast.  I still have to ask my friends if it's ok with them.  Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.  What do you think?"
"5770" "Toph" "   Go ahead and let him join.  It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet."
"5771" "Aang" "  Sokka?"
"5772" "Sokka" "   Hey, all I want is to defeat The Fire Lord.  If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it."
"5773" "Aang" "  Katara?"
"5774" "Katara" "  I'll go along with whatever you think is right."
"5775" "Zuko" "   I won't let you down, I promise."
"5776" "Sokka" "  So here you go, home sweet home.  I guess, you know, for now.   Unpack. . .  lunch soon.  Uh. . . welcome aboard?  Yeah.   Ok, this is really, really weird."
"5777" "Zuko" "  If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.  I know it's my destiny to capture him."
"5778" "Iroh" "  You know, Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing.  You never know how things are going to work out.  But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday."
"5779" "Katara" "   You might have everyone else here buying your transformation.  But you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past.   So let me tell you something right now.  You make one step backward, one slip- up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang. . .  and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore.  Because I'll make sure your destiny ends right then and there. . .  permanently."
"5780" "Zuko" "   I know you're nervous,  but remember. . .  firebending in and of itself is not something to fear."
"5781" "Aang" "   Ok.  Not something to fear."
"5782" "Zuko" "   But if you don't respect it,  it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!"
"5783" "Zuko" "  Now show me what you've got.  Any amount of fire you can make."
"5784" "Aang" "  Maybe I need a little more instruction.  Perhaps a demonstration?"
"5785" "Zuko" "   Good idea.  You might want to take a couple steps back."
"5786" "Zuko" "   What was that? !  That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!"
"5787" "Aang" "   I thought it was,  nice."
"5788" "Zuko" "   Why is this happening? !"
"5789" "Aang" "  Maybe it's the altitude."
"5790" "Zuko" "   Yeah, could be."
"5791" "Zuko" "  Just breathe, and. . ."
"5792" "Aang" "  That one kind of felt hot."
"5793" "Zuko" "   Don't patronize me.  You know what it's supposed to look like!"
"5794" "Aang" "  Sorry Sifu Hotman."
"5795" "Zuko" "   And stop calling me that!"
"5796" "Sokka" "  Hey, jerks.  Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerk bending?"
"5797" "Zuko" "  Get out of here!"
"5798" "Sokka" "  Ok, take it easy.   I was just kidding around.   Jerk bending, still got it."
"5799" "Zuko" "  Listen everybody;  I've got some pretty bad news.  I've lost my stuff."
"5800" "Toph" "   Don't look at me.  I didn't touch your stuff."
"5801" "Zuko" "  I'm talking about my firebending.  It's gone."
"5802" "Katara" "  I'm sorry.  I'm just laughing at the irony.  You know. . .  how it would have been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago?"
"5803" "Zuko" "  Well it's not lost.  It's just weaker for some reason."
"5804" "Katara" "   Maybe you're just not as good as you think you are."
"5805" "Toph" "  Ouch."
"5806" "Zuko" "  I bet it's because I changed sides."
"5807" "Katara" "  That's ridiculous."
"5808" "Aang" "  I don't know.  Maybe it isn't.  Maybe your firebending comes fromrage, and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to."
"5809" "Sokka" "   So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. . .  easy enough."
"5810" "Zuko" "   Ok, cut it out!   Look. . .  even if you're right,  I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore.  There has to be another way."
"5811" "Toph" "  You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending  from a different source.  I recommendthe original source."
"5812" "Sokka" "  How's he supposed to do that?  By jumping into a volcano?"
"5813" "Toph" "   No.  Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is."
"5814" "Sokka" "  So is it jumping into a volcano?"
"5815" "Toph" "  I don't know.  For earthbending,  the original benders were badgermoles."
"5816" "Toph" "   One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave."
"5817" "Toph" "  That's where I met them."
"5818" "Toph" "  They were blind, just like me,  so we understood each other.  I was able to learn earthbending,  not just as a martial art, but as anextension of my senses.   For them, the original earthbenders,  wasn't just about fighting.  It was their way of interacting with the World."
"5819" "Aang" "   That's amazing, Toph.  I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison.  Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime buddy."
"5820" "Zuko" "  Well, this doesn't help me.  The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct."
"5821" "Aang" "  What do you mean?  Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty ofdragons when I was a kid."
"5822" "Zuko" "   Well, they aren't around anymore, ok?"
"5823" "Aang" "  Ok, ok.   I'm sorry."
"5824" "Zuko" "  But maybe there's another way.   The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors."
"5825" "Aang" "   Sun Warriors?  Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid."
"5826" "Zuko" "  No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.  Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins."
"5827" "Aang" "  It's like the monks used to tell me.  Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present."
"5828" "Sokka" "   So, what?   Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood 1000 years ago?"
"5829" "Zuko" "  More or less.  Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher."
"5830" "Zuko" "  We've been riding for hours.  I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster."
"5831" "Aang" "  Appa's right, Zuko.  In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude."
"5832" "Zuko" "   I can't believe this."
"5833" "Aang" "  Don't worry.  You'll get the hang of it."
"5834" "Zuko" "  Even though these buildings are ancient,  there's something eerily familiar about them.  I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these."
"5835" "Aang" "  Ok, we learned something about architecture.   Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too.  The past can be a great teacher."
"5836" "Aang" "   Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me."
"5837" "Zuko" "   I can't believe it.  This booby trap must be centuries old, and it still works."
"5838" "Aang" "  There's probably a lot more.  Maybe this means we shouldn't be here."
"5839" "Zuko" "   Where's that upbeat attitude you were talking about?  Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting."
"5840" "Aang" "  Look.  This seems promising.   Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending."
"5841" "Zuko" "  They look pretty angry to me."
"5842" "Aang" "  I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors."
"5843" "Zuko" "  Well, they had a funny way of showing it."
"5844" "Aang" "  Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years.  Something you're not telling me."
"5845" "Zuko" "  My great- grandfather Sozin happened."
"5846" "Zuko" "  He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory.  They were the ultimate firebenders.  And if you could conquer one, your firebending talentswould become legendary, and you'd earn the honorary title Dragon.   The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born,  by my Uncle."
"5847" "Aang" "  But I thought your Uncle was, I don't know, good?"
"5848" "Zuko" "  He had a complicated past.  Family tradition, I guess.  Let's just move on."
"5849" "Aang" "  It's locked up."
"5850" "Zuko" "  Wait.   It's a celestial calendar.  Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples.  I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice."
"5851" "Aang" "   Monkey feathers!  The solstice again?  We can't wait here that long."
"5852" "Zuko" "  No we can't.   But we might be able to speed time up.  Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone."
"5853" "Aang" "  Nothing's happening."
"5854" "Zuko" "   Come on. . ."
"5855" "Aang" "   You know, Zuko, I don't care  what everyone else says about you,  you're pretty smart."
"5856" "Zuko" "  Relax.  They're just statues."
"5857" "Aang" "   It says this is something called The Dancing Dragon."
"5858" "Aang" "   Zuko, get over here.  Iwant you to dance with me."
"5859" "Zuko" "   What?"
"5860" "Aang" "  Just do it."
"5861" "Aang" "  Let's follow the steps of the statues."
"5862" "Aang" "  Don't you see?   These aren't dance moves.  These statues are giving us a lesson.   I think this is some kind of SunWarrior firebending form."
"5863" "Zuko" "   This better teach us some really good firebending."
"5864" "Aang" "   Hurray!  Wait.  What exactly is that?"
"5865" "Zuko" "  It's some kind of mystical gem stone."
"5866" "Aang" "  Well, don't touch it!"
"5867" "Zuko" "  Why not?"
"5868" "Aang" "  Remember what happened out there with those spikes  I'm just very suspicious of giant, glowing gems sitting on pedestals."
"5869" "Zuko" "  It feels almost alive."
"5870" "Aang" "   Oh, no, it's another trap!"
"5871" "Zuko" "  Ugh, I can't pull free.  It's like some kind of glue."
"5872" "Aang" "   I can't move.  Zuko, do something!"
"5873" "Zuko" "  Me?  I can't move either."
"5874" "Aang" "  It stopped."
"5875" "Zuko" "  At least we have air.  Maybe if we stay calm we can figure a way out of this."
"5876" "Aang" "  You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?"
"5877" "Zuko" "  At least I made something happen.  If it were up to you, we'd neverhave made it pass the courtyard."
"5878" "Aang" "   Help!"
"5879" "Zuko" "  Who are you yelling to?  Nobody's lived here for centuries."
"5880" "Aang" "  Well, what do you think we should do?"
"5881" "Zuko" "  Think about our place in the Universe?"
"5882" "Zuko" "   We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone.  We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending."
"5883" "Aang" "  Please, I don't normally play this card, but. . .   I'm the Avatar."
"5884" "Aang" "  Just hear us out."
"5885" "Zuko" "  My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.  Or at least, Iused to be.  I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending,  to be fueled by anger and rage.  But now I want to learn the true way,  the original way.  When we came here, I never imagined  the Sun Warrior civilization was secretly alive.  I am truly humbled to be in your presence.   Please, teach us."
"5886" "Aang" "  Ran and Shao?  There are two of them?"
"5887" "Zuko" "   I don't believe it."
"5888" "Aang" "   Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir?  Yeah. . .  I'm not a firebender yet.  Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?"
"5889" "Aang" "  I'm sorry.  I'm just a little nervous.   It's like a little heartbeat."
"5890" "Zuko" "  Hurry up."
"5891" "Aang" "  I can't.  If I walk too fast, myflame will go out."
"5892" "Zuko" "  Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small.  You're too timid.  Give it more juice."
"5893" "Aang" "   But what if I can't control it?"
"5894" "Zuko" "  You can do it.  I know you can.  You're a talented kid."
"5895" "Aang" "   But once they find out I'm the Avatar. . ."
"5896" "Aang" "  We could turn back now.  We've already learned more about fire than we hoped."
"5897" "Zuko" "  No, we're seeing this through to the end.  We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them."
"5898" "Aang" "  What if they judge us and attack us?"
"5899" "Zuko" "  Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.   I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are."
"5900" "Zuko" "   Bring 'em out."
"5901" "Aang" "  What's happening?"
"5902" "Aang" "   Zuko, my fire went out."
"5903" "Zuko" "   What do you want me to do?"
"5904" "Aang" "  Give me some of yours."
"5905" "Zuko" "  No, just make your own."
"5906" "Aang" "  I can't."
"5907" "Zuko" "  Get some from one of those warriors.   Hurry.  Stop cheating off me!"
"5908" "Aang" "   Quit being stingy!"
"5909" "Zuko" "  These are the masters."
"5910" "Aang" "   You still think we can take 'em?"
"5911" "Zuko" "  Shh.  I never said that."
"5912" "Aang" "   Zuko, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them."
"5913" "Zuko" "  What?  What about this situation that you think they want us to dance?"
"5914" "Aang" "  Well, I think they want us to do something.  Let's just try it."
"5915" "Zuko" "  Fine."
"5916" "Zuko" "  I understand."
"5917" "Zuko" "  Their fire was beautiful.  I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined."
"5918" "Aang" "  Like firebending harmony."
"5919" "Zuko" "  I can't believe there are still living dragons.  My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it."
"5920" "Aang" "  So, your Uncle lied."
"5921" "Zuko" "  He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them."
"5922" "Aang" "  All this time, I thought firebending was destruction.  Since I hurtKatara, I've been too afraid and hesitant.  But now I know what it really is. . .  it's energy, and life."
"5923" "Zuko" "  Yeah.  It's like the Sun,  but inside of you.  Do you guys realize this?"
"5924" "Zuko" "  That's why my firebending was so weak before.  Because for so manyyears, hunting you  was my drive. . .  it was my purpose.  So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire.  But now, I have a new drive.  I have to help you  defeat my father and restore balance to the world."
"5925" "Aang" "  With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I would be unstoppable."
"5926" "Sokka" "  Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there."
"5927" "Zuko" "   It's not a dance.  It's a firebending form."
"5928" "Sokka" "  We'll just tap- dance  our way to victory over the Fire Lord."
"5929" "Zuko" "   It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!"
"5930" "Katara" "  Oh yeah?  What's your little form called?"
"5931" "Zuko" "   The Dancing Dragon.  "
"5932" "Zuko" "   No one can make tea like Uncle.   But hopefully I learned a thing or two.  Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?"
"5933" "Katara" "  Sure."
"5934" "Aang" "  I like jokes."
"5935" "Toph" "  Bring it."
"5936" "Zuko" "  Okay.   Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line  is, Leaf me alone, I'm bushed.   Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it."
"5937" "Katara" "  Right.  Maybe that's because he remembers  the whole thing."
"5938" "Toph" "  It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.   It hardly ever happens."
"5939" "Sokka" "   Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
"5940" "Zuko" "  So  what's up?"
"5941" "Sokka" "   If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?"
"5942" "Zuko" "  What do you mean?  Who was captured?"
"5943" "Sokka" "  When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken.  I just want to know where  they might be."
"5944" "Zuko" "  I can't tell you."
"5945" "Sokka" "  What?  Why not?"
"5946" "Zuko" "  Trust me.  Knowing would just make you feel worse."
"5947" "Sokka" "  It's my Dad.  He was captured too.  I need to know what I put himthrough."
"5948" "Zuko" "  It's not good Sokka."
"5949" "Sokka" "  Please."
"5950" "Zuko" "   My guess is. . .   They were taken to the Boiling Rock."
"5951" "Sokka" "   What's that?"
"5952" "Zuko" "   The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.   It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.   It's inescapable."
"5953" "Sokka" "  So where is this place?"
"5954" "Zuko" "  Why do you need to know?  What are you planning?"
"5955" "Sokka" "  Nothing.  Boy, you're so paranoid."
"5956" "Zuko" "   It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation.  You guys actually flew right past it on your way here."
"5957" "Sokka" "  Thanks Zuko.   Just knowing makes me feel better."
"5958" "Zuko" "  Yeah, I'm sure it does."
"5959" "Zuko" "  Not up to anything, huh?"
"5960" "Sokka" "  Fine, you caught me.  I'm gonna rescue my Dad.   You happy now?"
"5961" "Zuko" "  I'm never happy."
"5962" "Sokka" "  Look, I have to do this.  The invasion plan was my idea.  It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong.   It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it.   I have to regain my honor.  You can't stop me Zuko."
"5963" "Zuko" "  You need to regain your honor?  Believe me, I get it.  I'm going with you."
"5964" "Sokka" "   No.  I have to do this alone."
"5965" "Zuko" "  How are you going to get there?  On Appa?  Last time I checked,  prisons don't have bison day cares."
"5966" "Zuko" "  We'll take my war balloon."
"5967" "Toph" "  What does it say?"
"5968" "Katara" "  Need meat.  Gone fishing.   Back in a few days.   Sokka and Zuko.  One more thing.   Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone.  Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.   Zuko."
"5969" "Aang" "  Nobody else has homework.   One hot squat.  Two hot squat.  Three hot squat.  Four hot. . ."
"5970" "Sokka" "   Pretty clouds."
"5971" "Zuko" "   Yeah, fluffy."
"5972" "Zuko" "   What?"
"5973" "Sokka" "  What?  Oh, I didn't say anything.  You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons."
"5974" "Zuko" "  No kidding."
"5975" "Sokka" "  Yep.  A balloon.  But for War."
"5976" "Zuko" "  There's one thing my Dad's good at,  it's War."
"5977" "Sokka" "   Yeah, it seems to run in the family."
"5978" "Zuko" "  Hey, hold on.  Not everyone in my family is like that."
"5979" "Sokka" "  I know, I know, you've changed."
"5980" "Zuko" "  I meant my Uncle.  He was more of a Father  to me.  And I really let him down."
"5981" "Sokka" "   I think your Uncle would be proud of you.  Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard."
"5982" "Zuko" "  It wasn't that hard."
"5983" "Sokka" "   Really?  You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?"
"5984" "Zuko" "  Well I did have a girlfriend.  Mai."
"5985" "Sokka" "   That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?"
"5986" "Zuko" "   Yeah.   Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.  I couldn't drag her into it."
"5987" "Sokka" "   My first girlfriend turned into the Moon."
"5988" "Zuko" "   That's rough buddy."
"5989" "Zuko" "  There it is."
"5990" "Zuko" "  There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.  As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught."
"5991" "Zuko" "  We're going down.  The balloon's not working anymore!"
"5992" "Sokka" "  The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly."
"5993" "Zuko" "  So what are we supposed to do?"
"5994" "Sokka" "   I don't know.  Crash landing?"
"5995" "Zuko" "  How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?"
"5996" "Sokka" "  We'll figure something out.  I suspected it might be a one- way ticket."
"5997" "Zuko" "   You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?"
"5998" "Sokka" "   My Dad might be here.  I had to come and see."
"5999" "Zuko" "  Uncle always said  I never thought things through, but this, ugh,  this is just crazy."
"6000" "Sokka" "   Hey!  I never wanted you to come along in the first place.  And for the record,  I always think things through.  But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time I'm playing it by ear.  So there."
"6001" "Zuko" "  What are you doing?"
"6002" "Sokka" "  It doesn't work anyway.   And we don't want anyone to find it."
"6003" "Zuko" "  I hope you know what you're doing.   There's no turning back now."
"6004" "Zuko" "  I hope these disguises work."
"6005" "Sokka" "  We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible."
"6006" "Sokka" "   We can't blow our cover."
"6007" "Zuko" "   Uh, yeah, very cute sir."
"6008" "Sokka" "  Super cute."
"6009" "Sokka" "   Meet back here in an hour."
"6010" "Sokka" "   Prisoners.  Am I right?"
"6011" "Zuko" "  But what if there's an incident?  If I'm not prepared someone couldstrike me on the head."
"6012" "Zuko" "   Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?"
"6013" "Zuko" "   No, that's not it.  The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right?  So what about war prisoners?"
"6014" "Sokka" "  It sure looks cold in there."
"6015" "Zuko" "  Hey there, fellow guard.  How goes it?"
"6016" "Sokka" "   Zuko?"
"6017" "Zuko" "   Shh.  Listen, I asked around the lounge.  There are no  WaterTribe prisoners.   I'm afraid your Father's not here."
"6018" "Sokka" "   What?  Are you sure?  Did you double check?"
"6019" "Zuko" "   Yeah, I'm sure."
"6020" "Sokka" "   No.   No!"
"6021" "Zuko" "  I'm really sorry Sokka."
"6022" "Sokka" "  So we came all this way for nothing.  I failed.   Again."
"6023" "Zuko" "  Err,  what would Uncle say?   Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light.  And a silver lining in between.  It's like a silver sandwich.  So. . .   when life seems hard. . .   take a bite out of the silver sandwich."
"6024" "Sokka" "  Maybe we haven't failed after all."
"6025" "Zuko" "  That's the spirit.  I can't believe  that worked.  I didn't even know what I was saying."
"6026" "Sokka" "  No, what you said made no sense at all.  But look,  it's Suki!"
"6027" "Sokka" "   You mean you don't recognize me?"
"6028" "Sokka" "   Oh.  Then maybe you'll recognize this."
"6029" "Sokka" "   The otherKyoshi Warriors, are they here?"
"6030" "Sokka" "  Well, you  won't be here for long, I'm busting you out."
"6031" "Zuko" "  No, you can't go in there.   The lights are out. . .  the prisoner  could sneak up on you."
"6032" "Sokka" "  You're under arrest!   Don't worry, I'll figure it out."
"6033" "Zuko" "   How did you know who I am?"
"6034" "Zuko" "   You're Mai's uncle?   I never meant to hurt her."
"6035" "Zuko" "  So what's in it for you?  Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward."
"6036" "Sokka" "   Oh, good.  You guys have met."
"6037" "Zuko" "  We did?"
"6038" "Zuko" "   Oh.  Sorry about that.  Nice to see you again."
"6039" "Sokka" "  So listen, I think I have an escape plan.   I checked out the Coolers again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?"
"6040" "Zuko" "  Yeah. . ."
"6041" "Sokka" "  So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.  Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right?"
"6042" "Sokka" "  It's a perfect boat  for getting through the boiling water."
"6043" "Zuko" "   The cooler as a boat?  Are you sure?"
"6044" "Sokka" "   I'm telling you, it'll work."
"6045" "Sokka" "   I walked around the perimeter.  There's a blind spot  between two guard towers.  It's the perfect launching point.  I already tested it out.   We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current.   It'll take us straight across.  As long as we don't make a sound,  no one will notice.  And bing, bang, boom we're home free."
"6046" "Sokka" "   What?   We didn't.  We. . .  We didn't say that."
"6047" "Zuko" "  Yeah, you heard wrong."
"6048" "Zuko" "  There's nothing to get in on."
"6049" "Sokka" "  Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is. . .  an egg?"
"6050" "Sokka" "  Okay, you're in.  Now, first we need someone  to unbolt the Cooler.   From the inside."
"6051" "Zuko" "  Hey, you watch who you're shoving."
"6052" "Sokka" "   I need backup over here."
"6053" "Sokka" "  I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson."
"6054" "Zuko" "   Yes, I have.  Completely."
"6055" "Sokka" "   I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago.  They'll be waiting for us at the shore."
"6056" "Zuko" "  Someone's coming."
"6057" "Zuko" "   War prisoners.  It could be your Father."
"6058" "Sokka" "  I know."
"6059" "Zuko" "  Well, what should  we do?  Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?"
"6060" "Sokka" "   I don't know.   Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom?  All of ourfreedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?"
"6061" "Zuko" "  It's your call Sokka."
"6062" "Sokka" "   Fine, everybody in the cooler.  Let's go."
"6063" "Zuko" "   Are you sure you want to go?   You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself.  Redeem your honor.  Rescuing your Dad is your chance."
"6064" "Sokka" "   If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.  Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail."
"6065" "Zuko" "   No, it's not.  Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out."
"6066" "Sokka" "   That's supposed to make me feel better?"
"6067" "Zuko" "  Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again."
"6068" "Sokka" "  Seriously, not helping."
"6069" "Zuko" "   You have to try every time.  You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail."
"6070" "Sokka" "  No, I'm staying.   You guys go.   You've been here long enough."
"6071" "Zuko" "   I'm staying too."
"6072" "Sokka" "   We gave up our only chance of escaping.   I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake."
"6073" "Sokka" "  The plan failed!  They're caught."
"6074" "Sokka" "  The gondola's moving."
"6075" "Sokka" "  This is it."
"6076" "Sokka" "  If my Dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing."
"6077" "Sokka" "   Come on, come on."
"6078" "Zuko" "   Is that him?"
"6079" "Sokka" "   My Dad doesn't have a nose ring."
"6080" "Sokka" "   Where is he?"
"6081" "Sokka" "   That's it?  That can't be it."
"6082" "Sokka" "  Oh no."
"6083" "Sokka" "  Dad."
"6084" "Sokka" "  Dad.   Excuse me, coming through.  The Warden wants me over there  sorry."
"6085" "Sokka" "  Thank goodness you're okay."
"6086" "Sokka" "   Dad, it's me."
"6087" "Sokka" "  Yeah,  I ran into that problem earlier."
"6088" "Sokka" "  So where's Bato?   Where's everyone else from the invasion?"
"6089" "Sokka" "  You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?"
"6090" "Sokka" "  Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us."
"6091" "Sokka" "  And you know Prince Zuko?"
"6092" "Sokka" "  Well, he's here too."
"6093" "Sokka" "  Actually, he's on our side now.   I know, I had the same reaction.  After all he has done, it was hard to trust him.  But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help."
"6094" "Sokka" "  We had one  but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.   I don't know ifthere's another way off this island."
"6095" "Sokka" "  Then we'd better find two."
"6096" "Sokka" "  Zuko, are you there?"
"6097" "Zuko" "   I'm here."
"6098" "Sokka" "  I just got done talking to my Dad.  We came up with an escape plan together."
"6099" "Sokka" "   I was just  telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!"
"6100" "Sokka" "   Why?"
"6101" "Sokka" "   Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?"
"6102" "Sokka" "   Take that!  And this!"
"6103" "Sokka" "   We have a new plan but it's gonna need a big distraction.   Be in the yard in one hour."
"6104" "Zuko" "  What are you doing?  Where are you taking me?"
"6105" "Zuko" "  I didn't do anything wrong."
"6106" "Zuko" "   Mai."
"6107" "Zuko" "  How did you know I was here?"
"6108" "Zuko" "   But. . .  how?"
"6109" "Zuko" "   I didn't mean to. . ."
"6110" "Zuko" "   Stop!   This isn't about you.  This is about the Fire Nation."
"6111" "Zuko" "   Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.   But I have to do this to save my country."
"6112" "Zuko" "   That's not how I see it."
"6113" "Sokka" "  I don't have much time.   If I'm seen with you  the guards might think something's up.   I just talked to my Dad."
"6114" "Sokka" "  Yeah and we're escaping today.  On the gondola."
"6115" "Sokka" "  My dad and I came up with a plan together.  We're gonna commandeer the gondola and  we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines."
"6116" "Sokka" "  My dad already thought of that.  He said we'll need a distraction.  That's why we're gonna start a prison riot."
"6117" "Sokka" "  Not if the Warden is the captive.   I have to go.   I'll find you before we start the riot."
"6118" "Sokka" "   Why?"
"6119" "Sokka" "  Maybe I could schedule another time with him?  How's tomorrow?"
"6120" "Sokka" "   Hey, I just got orders.  Let the prisoners out into the yard."
"6121" "Sokka" "  Oh, okay.   I'll just go tell the Warden you said that.  I'm sure  he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.   What's your name again?"
"6122" "Sokka" "   Hey, I'm confused too.   But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational.  So if you ask me,  it's best not to question it and just do what hesays."
"6123" "Sokka" "  This is it.  We have to start a riot."
"6124" "Sokka" "  This isn't working."
"6125" "Sokka" "  Actually, we're trying to escape right now.  But we need a riot.   You wouldn't happen to know how to start one would you?"
"6126" "Zuko" "   Hah, believe me.  She doesn't."
"6127" "Sokka" "  Zuko, good.  We're all here.  Now all we need to do  is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas."
"6128" "Zuko" "  And how do we do that?"
"6129" "Sokka" "   I'm not sure."
"6130" "Zuko" "  Argh, I thought you thought this through."
"6131" "Sokka" "   I thought you told me it's okay not to thinkeverything through!"
"6132" "Zuko" "   Maybe not everything.  But this is kind of important."
"6133" "Sokka" "   Tell me about it."
"6134" "Zuko" "  Back off, we've got the Warden."
"6135" "Zuko" "  Let's go."
"6136" "Sokka" "   What are you doing?"
"6137" "Zuko" "  I'm making it so they can't stop us."
"6138" "Sokka" "  Way to think ahead."
"6139" "Zuko" "   That's a problem.   It's my sister and her friend."
"6140" "Zuko" "  Me too."
"6141" "Zuko" "  They're cutting the line.  The gondola's about to go!"
"6142" "Sokka" "   Who is that?"
"6143" "Zuko" "   It's Mai."
"6144" "Sokka" "   Zuko, what are you doing?"
"6145" "Zuko" "  My sister was on that island."
"6146" "Sokka" "  Yeah and she's probably right behind us.  So let's not stop."
"6147" "Zuko" "  What I mean is she must have come here somehow.   There.   That's our way out of here."
"6148" "Katara" "  What are you doing in this thing?  What happened to the war balloon?"
"6149" "Zuko" "   It kind of got destroyed."
"6150" "Aang" "   Sounds like a crazy fishing trip."
"6151" "Toph" "  Did you at least get some good meat?"
"6152" "Sokka" "   I did.   The best meat of all.   The meat of friendship and fatherhood."
"6153" "Katara" "   Dad."
"6154" "Katara" "   How are you here?  What is going on?   Where did you go?"
"6155" "Sokka" "   We. . .  kind of went to a Fire Nation prison."
"6156" "Toph" "   Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat?  "
"6157" "Zuko" "   Watch out!"
"6158" "Katara" "  What are you doing? !"
"6159" "Zuko" "  Keeping rocks from crushing you."
"6160" "Katara" "  Okay, I'm not crushed.  You can get off me now."
"6161" "Zuko" "  I'll take that as a thank you."
"6162" "Toph" "   Come on, we can get out through here!"
"6163" "Aang" "  What are you doing?"
"6164" "Zuko" "   Go ahead, I'll hold them off.  I think this is a family visit."
"6165" "Aang" "   Zuko, no!"
"6166" "Sokka" "   Come on, we gotta get out of here."
"6167" "Zuko" "   What are you doing here?"
"6168" "Aang" "   I can't get him to go in there.  Appa hates tunnels."
"6169" "Katara" "   Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here."
"6170" "Aang" "  We'll have to finda way."
"6171" "Sokka" "  We need to split up.   Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship."
"6172" "Katara" "   No,  the Fire Nation can't separate our family again."
"6173" "Toph" "   I can clear that away and we can fly out through there."
"6174" "Aang" "   We'll get through, let's go."
"6175" "Zuko" "  She's not going to make it."
"6176" "Zuko" "  Of course she did."
"6177" "Aang" "  Wow, camping."
"6178" "Katara" "   Haha."
"6179" "Sokka" "   To Zuko.  Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero."
"6180" "Zuko" "   I'm touched.  I don't deserve this."
"6181" "Katara" "   Yeah, no kidding."
"6182" "Sokka" "   What's with her?"
"6183" "Zuko" "   I wish I knew."
"6184" "Sokka" "  What's with him?"
"6185" "Zuko" "  This isn't fair.   Everyone else seems to trust me now.  What is it with you?"
"6186" "Katara" "   Oh, everyone trust you now?   I was the first person to trust you, remember Back in Ba Sing Se.   And you turned  around and betrayed me.  Betrayed all of us."
"6187" "Zuko" "   What can I do to make it up to you?"
"6188" "Katara" "  You really want to know?   Hmm, maybe you could re- conquer  Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.  Or,  I know.  You could bring my mother back."
"6189" "Zuko" "   Sorry.  Do you need to talk to Sokka too?"
"6190" "Sokka" "   Well, hellooo.   Uh, Zuko.  Yes,  why would  I be expecting any one different?   So what's on your mind?"
"6191" "Zuko" "  Your sister, she hates me and I don't know why!  But I do care what she thinks of me."
"6192" "Sokka" "  Nah, she doesn't hate you.  Katara doesn't hate anyone.   Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.   No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad.   I mean, bad people.  Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good  and probably won't be ever!"
"6193" "Zuko" "   Stop.  Okay, listen.  I know this may seem out of no where,  but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother."
"6194" "Sokka" "   What?  Why would you want to know that?"
"6195" "Zuko" "  Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me.  I think somehow. . .  she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me."
"6196" "Sokka" "   It's not a day I like to remember."
"6197" "Katara" "  I'm going to find Mum."
"6198" "Sokka" "   Many of the warriors  have seen the black snow before  and they knew what it meant.   A Fire Nation raid."
"6199" "Sokka" "   We were badly outnumbered.   But somehow, we managed to drive them off.   As quickly as they came,  they just left.   I was so relieved when it was over but, that's because I didn't know yet what havehappened.   I didn't know we lost our Mother."
"6200" "Zuko" "  Wait.  Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village Like, what the lead ship looked like?"
"6201" "Sokka" "   Yeah. . .   Sea Ravens.  The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them."
"6202" "Zuko" "  The symbol of The Southern Raiders.  Thanks, Sokka."
"6203" "Sokka" "  No problem.   Thanks for stopping by.   Thought he never leave.   Suki."
"6204" "Katara" "   You look terrible."
"6205" "Zuko" "   I waited out here all night."
"6206" "Katara" "  What do you want?"
"6207" "Zuko" "   I know who killed your Mother.   I'm going to help you find him."
"6208" "Katara" "  I need to borrow Appa."
"6209" "Aang" "   Why?  Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?"
"6210" "Katara" "  Yes, it is."
"6211" "Aang" "   Oh.  What's going on?"
"6212" "Katara" "  We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me."
"6213" "Zuko" "   Sokka told me the story of what happened.  I know who did it.  And I know how to find him."
"6214" "Aang" "  Umm. . .  and what exactly do you think this would accomplish?"
"6215" "Katara" "   I knew you wouldn't understand."
"6216" "Aang" "   Wait, stop, I do understand.  You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage.  How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa?  How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?"
"6217" "Zuko" "   She needs this,  Aang.  This is about getting closure and justice."
"6218" "Aang" "  I don't think so.  I think it's about getting revenge."
"6219" "Katara" "   Fine!   Maybe it is.  Maybe that's what I need.  Maybe that's what he deserves."
"6220" "Aang" "  Katara, you sound like Jet."
"6221" "Katara" "   It's not the same.  Jet attacked the innocent.  This man, he's a monster."
"6222" "Sokka" "  Katara, she was my Mother too.  But I think Aang might be right."
"6223" "Katara" "  Then you didn't love her the way I did."
"6224" "Sokka" "   Katara. . ."
"6225" "Aang" "  The monks used to say that revenge is like a two- headed ratviper.  While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself."
"6226" "Zuko" "  That's cute.  But this isn't air temple pre- school.  It's the real World."
"6227" "Katara" "   Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice."
"6228" "Aang" "  Katara, you do have a choice.  Forgiveness."
"6229" "Zuko" "  That's the same as doing nothing."
"6230" "Aang" "   No it's not.  It's easy to do nothing.   But it's hard to forgive."
"6231" "Katara" "   It's not just hard, it's impossible."
"6232" "Aang" "   So you were just going to take Appa anyway?"
"6233" "Katara" "  Yes."
"6234" "Aang" "  It's okay, because I forgive you.   That give you any ideas?"
"6235" "Katara" "   Don't try to stop us."
"6236" "Aang" "  I wasn't planning to.  This is a journey you need to take.  You need to face this man.   But when you do, please don't choose revenge.   Let your anger out and then let it go.  Forgive him."
"6237" "Zuko" "   Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru- goody- goody."
"6238" "Katara" "   Thanks for understanding Aang.  Yip yip."
"6239" "Sokka" "  You know, you're pretty wise for a kid."
"6240" "Aang" "  Thanks, Sokka."
"6241" "Sokka" "  Usually it's annoying but right now, I'm just impressed."
"6242" "Aang" "   I appreciate that."
"6243" "Sokka" "  So. . .  can I borrow Momo for a week?"
"6244" "Aang" "   Why do you need Momo?"
"6245" "Zuko" "   We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower.   All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk.  And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed."
"6246" "Katara" "   So once  we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need."
"6247" "Zuko" "   Not exactly.   We need to be stealthy  and make sure no one spots us.  Otherwise,  they'll warn The Southern Raiders.  Long before we reach them."
"6248" "Zuko" "  Okay,Southern Raiders.   There.   On patrol near Whale Tail Island."
"6249" "Katara" "   Whale Tail Island, here we come."
"6250" "Zuko" "   You should get some rest.  We'll be there in a few hours.  You'll need all your strength."
"6251" "Katara" "  Now, don't you worry about my strength.  I have plenty.   I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came."
"6252" "Katara" "  I'm going to find Mum."
"6253" "Katara" "  Mum!"
"6254" "Katara" "   Mum, I'm scared."
"6255" "Katara" "   I ran as fast as I could."
"6256" "Katara" "   Dad!  Dad!   Please, I think Mum's in trouble!  There's a man in our house."
"6257" "Katara" "  But, we were too late.  When we got there, the man was gone.   And so was she."
"6258" "Zuko" "   Your Mother was a brave woman."
"6259" "Katara" "   I know."
"6260" "Zuko" "  There!   See those Sea Raven flags?   It's The Southern Raiders."
"6261" "Katara" "   Let's do this."
"6262" "Zuko" "  This is it, Katara.  Are you ready to face him?"
"6263" "Zuko" "   You don't remember her?  You will soon.  Trust me."
"6264" "Zuko" "  Think back.  Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe."
"6265" "Zuko" "   Don't lie!  You look her  in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did."
"6266" "Katara" "   It's not him.   He's not the man."
"6267" "Zuko" "   What? !  What do you mean he's not?  He's a leader of The Southern Raiders!   He has to be the guy!"
"6268" "Zuko" "  If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?"
"6269" "Katara" "  That was him.   That was the monster."
"6270" "Zuko" "  We weren't behind the bush.  And I wouldn't try firebending again."
"6271" "Katara" "  Do you know who I am?"
"6272" "Katara" "  Oh you better remember me like your life depends on it!   Why don't you take a closer look."
"6273" "Katara" "   Mum, I'm scared."
"6274" "Katara" "  She lied to you.   She was protecting the last waterbender."
"6275" "Katara" "   ME!"
"6276" "Katara" "   I always wonder what kind of person could do such a thing.  But now that I see you, I think I understand.   There's just nothing inside you.  Nothing at all.  You're pathetic and sad and empty."
"6277" "Katara" "   But as much as I hate you. . .   I just can't do it."
"6278" "Aang" "   Katara!   Are you okay?"
"6279" "Katara" "   I'm doing fine."
"6280" "Aang" "   Zuko told me what you did.   Or. . .  what you didn't do, I guess.  I'm proud of you."
"6281" "Katara" "  I wanted to do it.  I wanted to take out all my anger at him but, I couldn't.   I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or if it's because I'm strong enough not to."
"6282" "Aang" "   You did the right thing.   Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing."
"6283" "Katara" "   But I didn't forgive him.  I'll never forgive him.   But I am  ready to forgive you."
"6284" "Zuko" "   You were right about what Katara needed.  Violence wasn't the answer."
"6285" "Aang" "  It never is."
"6286" "Zuko" "  Then I have a question for you.   What are you going to do when you face my Father?"
"6287" "Katara" "   Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding  from the Fire Lord in his own house?"
"6288" "Zuko" "   I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy.  And that was a long time ago.  This is the last place anyone would think to look for us."
"6289" "Sokka" "   You guys are not going to believe this.  There's a play about us."
"6290" "Katara" "   What?   How is that possible?"
"6291" "Sokka" "   Listen to this.   The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured  the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.   His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage."
"6292" "Zuko" "  Ugh.   My Mother used to take us to see them.  They butchered Love Amongst The Dragons every year."
"6293" "Katara" "   Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?"
"6294" "Sokka" "  Come on, a day at the theatre?   This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing."
"6295" "Aang" "  Hey, uh. . .  I wanted to sit  there."
"6296" "Zuko" "   Just sit next to me, what's the big deal?"
"6297" "Aang" "  I was  just. . .  I wanted to. . .   Okay."
"6298" "Toph" "   Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section?  My feet  can't see a thing from up here."
"6299" "Katara" "  Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening."
"6300" "Sokka" "  This is pathetic.  My  jokes are way funnier than this."
"6301" "Toph" "   I think he's got you pegged."
"6302" "Katara" "   Well,  that's just silly.  I don't sound like that."
"6303" "Toph" "   Oh man, this writer's a genius."
"6304" "Aang" "   Wait, is that a woman playing me?"
"6305" "Aang" "   I don't do that.  That's not what I'm like!  And. . .  I'm not a woman!"
"6306" "Toph" "   Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes."
"6307" "Zuko" "   They make metotally stiff and humorless."
"6308" "Katara" "  Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on."
"6309" "Zuko" "   How could you say that?"
"6310" "Sokka" "   Shh.  I'm trying to watch."
"6311" "Zuko" "  So far, this intermission is the best part of the play."
"6312" "Sokka" "   Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot  who tells bad jokes about meat all the time."
"6313" "Sokka" "   I know!"
"6314" "Aang" "   At least this Sokka actor kinda looks like you.   That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all."
"6315" "Toph" "  I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys."
"6316" "Katara" "   Relax, Aang.   They're not accurate portrayals.  It's not like I'm  a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.   What?"
"6317" "Aang" "  Yeah.   That's not you at all."
"6318" "Toph" "  Listen, friends.  It's obvious that the playwright did his research.  I know it must hurt but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth."
"6319" "Toph" "   This is it!  This must be where I  come in."
"6320" "Toph" "   Here it comes."
"6321" "Toph" "  Wait a minute,  I sound like. . .   a guy.  A really buff guy."
"6322" "Katara" "   Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth.  It hurts, doesn't it?"
"6323" "Toph" "   Are you kidding me?   I wouldn't have cast it any other way.  At least it's not a flying bald lady."
"6324" "Zuko" "  Did Jet just. . .  die?"
"6325" "Sokka" "  You know, it was really unclear."
"6326" "Sokka" "   Oh, you're getting up?  Can you get me some fire flakes?   Oh and  fire gummies."
"6327" "Katara" "  You didn't really say that, did you?"
"6328" "Zuko" "   I might as well have."
"6329" "Sokka" "   You're one to talk, Suki.  Didn't Azula take you captive?  That's right, she did."
"6330" "Sokka" "   I'm just saying."
"6331" "Katara" "   Does anyone know where Aang is?"
"6332" "Sokka" "  He left to get me fire gummies like, 10 minutes ago.   And I'm still waiting."
"6333" "Katara" "  I'm going to check outside."
"6334" "Katara" "   Are you alright?"
"6335" "Aang" "  No, I'm not.   I hate this play."
"6336" "Katara" "   I know it's upsetting but it sounds like you're overreacting."
"6337" "Aang" "   Overreacting?  If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State  right now."
"6338" "Sokka" "  Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage I got some jokes I want to give to the actor >me."
"6339" "Toph" "  Jeez.  Everyone's getting so upset about their characters.  Even you seem more down than usual and that's saying something."
"6340" "Zuko" "  You don't get it.   It's different for you.  You get a muscley version of yourself taking down 10 bad guys at once and making sassy remarks."
"6341" "Toph" "  Yeah, that's pretty great."
"6342" "Zuko" "   But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life and shove them back in my face.   My Uncle.  He's always been on my side even when things were bad.  He was there for me.  He taught me so much and how do I repay him?   With a knife in his back.  It's my greatest regret  and I may never get to redeem myself."
"6343" "Toph" "   You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle.   You don't realize it but you already have."
"6344" "Zuko" "  How do you know?"
"6345" "Toph" "  Because I once had a long conversation with the guy and all he would talk about was you."
"6346" "Zuko" "  Really?"
"6347" "Toph" "  Yeah, and it was kind of annoying."
"6348" "Zuko" "  Oh, sorry."
"6349" "Toph" "  But it was also very sweet.   All your Uncle wanted was for you to find your own path and see the light.  Now you're here with us.   He'd be proud."
"6350" "Zuko" "  Ow.   What was that for?"
"6351" "Toph" "   That's how I show affection."
"6352" "Zuko" "  The scar  is not on the wrong side!"
"6353" "Sokka" "   Actually, I think I can help you.   I'm a big Sokka fan but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be."
"6354" "Sokka" "   Just hear me out.  Here's something  I think the real Sokka would say.   What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?   A cabbage patch."
"6355" "Sokka" "   Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases.   Especially before an attack.  Something like Flying Kick- A- Pow!"
"6356" "Sokka" "  I'm just a guy who likes comedy."
"6357" "Aang" "   Katara,  did you really mean what you said in there?"
"6358" "Katara" "   In where?  What are you talking about?"
"6359" "Aang" "   On stage.  When you said  I was just like a brother  to you and you didn't have feelings for me."
"6360" "Katara" "   I didn't say that.  An actor  said that."
"6361" "Aang" "  But it's true, isn't it?   We kissed at the invasion and I thought we were going to be together but we're not."
"6362" "Katara" "   Aang,  I don't know."
"6363" "Aang" "  Why don't you know?"
"6364" "Katara" "   Because we're in the middle of a war and  we have other things to worry about.  This isn't the right time."
"6365" "Aang" "   Well, when is the right time?"
"6366" "Katara" "   Aang, I'm sorry but right now,  I'm just a little confused."
"6367" "Katara" "   I just said that I was confused.   I'm going inside."
"6368" "Aang" "   Argh!   I'm such an idiot!"
"6369" "Sokka" "   Here's what you missed.   We went to the Fire Nation and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady  and I got a sword and I think Combustion Man died.   Ooo look, The Invasion's  about to start.  Shh."
"6370" "Sokka" "   I told him to say that."
"6371" "Sokka" "  I guess that's it.   The play's caught up to the present now."
"6372" "Sokka" "  But it is over.   Unless. . .   This is the future."
"6373" "Zuko" "  That. . .  wasn't a good play."
"6374" "Aang" "  I'll say."
"6375" "Katara" "  No kidding."
"6376" "Toph" "  You said it."
"6377" "Sokka" "  But the effects  were decent.  "
"6378" "Zuko" "  More ferocious!"
"6379" "Zuko" "  Imagine striking through your opponent's heart."
"6380" "Aang" "  Ugh!  I'm trying."
"6381" "Zuko" "  Now let me hear you roar like a tiger- dillo!"
"6382" "Zuko" "  That sounded pathetic!   I said roar!"
"6383" "Katara" "  Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice?"
"6384" "Aang" "  Ooo, ooo,  me, me, me!"
"6385" "Zuko" "  Hey,  your lesson's not over yet!   Get back here."
"6386" "Zuko" "  Fine."
"6387" "Zuko" "  If you want to lounge around  like a bunch of snail- sloths all day, then go ahead!"
"6388" "Sokka" "   Maybe Zuko's right.   Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy.  But I know  just the thing to change that.  Beach party!"
"6389" "Aang" "   Check out my Appa sand sculpture."
"6390" "Toph" "  Not bad, baldy.  But I've been working on my sandbending  You're gonna love this."
"6391" "Aang" "  Whoa.   Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco."
"6392" "Toph" "  Try and top that, Sokka."
"6393" "Sokka" "  Ta- da!"
"6394" "Aang" "  Is that a blubbering, blob monster?"
"6395" "Sokka" "  No,  it's Suki."
"6396" "Toph" "  Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this."
"6397" "Aang" "  But it doesn't even look like. . ."
"6398" "Aang" "  What are you doing? !"
"6399" "Zuko" "   Teaching you a lesson!"
"6400" "Katara" "  What happened?"
"6401" "Sokka" "  Zuko's gone crazy!  I made a sand sculpture of Suki  and he destroyed it!  Oh, and he's attacking Aang."
"6402" "Aang" "  Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!"
"6403" "Zuko" "  Go ahead and do it!"
"6404" "Aang" "   Enough!"
"6405" "Katara" "  What's wrong with you? !   You could have hurt Aang."
"6406" "Zuko" "  What's wrong with me?  What's wrong with all of you!   How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet  is only 3 days away!"
"6407" "Zuko" "  Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?"
"6408" "Aang" "  About Sozin's Comet. . .   I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came."
"6409" "Zuko" "  After?"
"6410" "Aang" "  I'm not ready.   I need more time to master firebending."
"6411" "Toph" "  And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too."
"6412" "Zuko" "  So. . .  You all knew Aang was going to wait?"
"6413" "Sokka" "  Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose.  No offence."
"6414" "Katara" "  The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the war.  But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se.  Things can't get any worse."
"6415" "Zuko" "  You're wrong.   It's about to get worse than you can even imagine."
"6416" "Zuko" "   The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend an important war meeting.   It was what I dreamed about  and wanted  for so many years.  My Father  had finally accepted me back."
"6417" "Zuko" "   The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong.  They can endure anything as long as they have hope."
"6418" "Zuko" "   Well, that's not exactly what I. . ."
"6419" "Zuko" "   I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan.   But I'm ashamed to say I didn't.   My whole life I struggled to gain my Father's love and acceptance.   But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there.   I forgotten who I was."
"6420" "Katara" "  I can't believe this."
"6421" "Sokka" "  I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil."
"6422" "Aang" "  What am I going to do?"
"6423" "Zuko" "  I know you're scared.   And I know that you're not ready to save the World.  But if you don't defeat theFire Lord before the comet comes,  there won't be a World to save anymore."
"6424" "Aang" "  Why  didn't you tell me  about your Dad's crazy plan sooner?"
"6425" "Zuko" "   I didn't think I had to.  I assumed that you were still going to fight him before the comet.  No one told me you decided to wait!"
"6426" "Aang" "  This is bad.   This is really,  really bad."
"6427" "Katara" "   Aang, you  don't have to do this alone."
"6428" "Toph" "  Yeah.   If we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down."
"6429" "Sokka" "  Alright!   Team Avatar is back!   Air.   Water.   Earth.   Fire.   Fan  and sword!"
"6430" "Aang" "  Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together.  But I wouldn't want to do it any other way."
"6431" "Toph" "  Yeah."
"6432" "Sokka" "  Alright."
"6433" "Katara" "  Get over here, Zuko.  Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs."
"6434" "Zuko" "  There's one technique you need  to know before facing my Father.  How to redirect lightning.   If you let the energy in your own body flow,  the lightning will follow it.   You turn your opponent's energy against them."
"6435" "Aang" "  That's like waterbending."
"6436" "Zuko" "  Exactly.  My Uncle  invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders."
"6437" "Aang" "  So. . .  Have you ever redirected lightning before?"
"6438" "Zuko" "  Once.  Against my Father."
"6439" "Aang" "  What did it feel like?"
"6440" "Zuko" "  Exhilarating.   But terrifying.   You feel so powerful  holding that much energy in your body.  But you know that you make the wrong move, it's over."
"6441" "Aang" "  Heh.   Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water  action. . .  Am I right?"
"6442" "Katara" "   Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you."
"6443" "Aang" "  Oh."
"6444" "Zuko" "   You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life.  Before he takes yours."
"6445" "Aang" "  Yeah. . .  I'll just do that."
"6446" "Sokka" "   Gather round Team Avatar.   In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the Melon Lord, our timing has to be perfect.   First, Suki and I will draw his fire.   Then, Katara and Zuko  charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the Melon Lord is distracted, Aang swoops in and BAM!   He delivers the final blow."
"6447" "Toph" "  Err. . .   what about me?"
"6448" "Sokka" "   For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces."
"6449" "Toph" "  So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?"
"6450" "Sokka" "  Whatever makes the training feel more realistic."
"6451" "Toph" "  Sweetness."
"6452" "Toph" "  Muahahahahahaha!"
"6453" "Sokka" "   Watch it, Toph!"
"6454" "Toph" "   I am not Toph, I am Melon Lord!  Muahahahahaha!"
"6455" "Sokka" "   Now, Aang!"
"6456" "Zuko" "   What are you waiting for?  Take him out!"
"6457" "Aang" "   I can't."
"6458" "Sokka" "  What's wrong with you?   If this was the real deal,  you'd be shot full of lightning  right now."
"6459" "Aang" "  I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right.  I didn't feel like myself."
"6460" "Sokka" "   There.   That's how it's done."
"6461" "Katara" "  I have a surprise for everyone!"
"6462" "Toph" "   I knew it!  You did have a secret thing with Haru!"
"6463" "Katara" "  Er, no.   I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.   Look at baby Zuko!   Isn't he cute?"
"6464" "Katara" "   Oh lighten up, I was just teasing."
"6465" "Zuko" "   That's not me.  It's my Father."
"6466" "Zuko" "  Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster.  And the worst Father in the history of Fathers."
"6467" "Aang" "  But he is still a human being."
"6468" "Zuko" "  You're going to defend him?"
"6469" "Aang" "  No, I agree with you.  Fire Lord Ozai  is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him.  There's gotta be another way."
"6470" "Zuko" "   Like what?"
"6471" "Aang" "   I don't know.  Maybe  we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore."
"6472" "Zuko" "   Yeah.  Then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories  will make him good again."
"6473" "Aang" "   Do you really think that would work?"
"6474" "Zuko" "   No!"
"6475" "Aang" "   This goes against  everything I learned from the monks.  I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like. . ."
"6476" "Sokka" "  Sure, you can.  You're the Avatar.  If it's in the name of keeping balance,  I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you."
"6477" "Aang" "   This isn't a joke, Sokka!  None of you understands the position I'm in!"
"6478" "Katara" "  Aang, we do understand.  It's just. . ."
"6479" "Aang" "   Just what, Katara? !  What?"
"6480" "Katara" "   We're trying to help."
"6481" "Aang" "   Then when you  figure out a way for me  to beat the Fire Lord without  taking his life, I love to hear it!"
"6482" "Katara" "  Aang, don't walk away from this."
"6483" "Zuko" "  Let him go.  He needs time to sort it out by himself."
"6484" "Aang" "  Hey, Momo.   I don't suppose you know what I should do.   I didn't think so."
"6485" "Toph" "   No, it's not.   Where's Aang?"
"6486" "Zuko" "   Aang?  Aang!"
"6487" "Toph" "  Come on lazy bones, let's go."
"6488" "Sokka" "   He left his staff.  That's so strange."
"6489" "Zuko" "  Aang's not in the house.  Let's check the beach."
"6490" "Sokka" "  Look!  There's his footprints.   The trail ends here."
"6491" "Katara" "  Maybe he was captured."
"6492" "Sokka" "  I don't think so.  There's no sign of a struggle."
"6493" "Toph" "   I bet he ran away again."
"6494" "Sokka" "  Ah- uh.  He left behind his glider and Appa."
"6495" "Toph" "  Then what do you think happened to him oh sleuthy one?"
"6496" "Sokka" "  It's pretty obvious.   Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle?  He's definitely on a Spirit World journey."
"6497" "Zuko" "  But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?"
"6498" "Sokka" "   Oh yeah, forgot about that."
"6499" "Katara" "  Then he's gotta be somewhere on Ember Island.  Let's split up and look for him."
"6500" "Toph" "   I'm going with Zuko!   What?  Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko.  Now it's my turn."
"6501" "Toph" "   And then when I was nine, I ran away again."
"6502" "Zuko" "  Uh- huh."
"6503" "Toph" "  I know I shouldn't complain,  my parents gave me everything that I ever asked for.  But they never gave me the one thing that I really wanted.  Their love.  You know what I mean?"
"6504" "Zuko" "   Look, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang."
"6505" "Toph" "   This is the worst fieldtrip ever."
"6506" "Sokka" "  Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang either."
"6507" "Zuko" "  No.  It's like he just. . .  disappeared."
"6508" "Toph" "   Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too?"
"6509" "Sokka" "   Oh no!   I knew it was only a matter of time.  Appa ate Momo!"
"6510" "Sokka" "   That's just what Appa wants you to think."
"6511" "Zuko" "   Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.   We have a real problem here.  Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away."
"6512" "Katara" "   What should we do Zuko?"
"6513" "Zuko" "   I don't know.   Why are you all looking at me?"
"6514" "Katara" "   Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang."
"6515" "Toph" "   Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar, it's you."
"6516" "Sokka" "  Zuko, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom?  There's no way Aang's there."
"6517" "Zuko" "   Just trust me."
"6518" "Katara" "   And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?"
"6519" "Zuko" "  June."
"6520" "Sokka" "   Oh yeah  that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole."
"6521" "Sokka" "   No,  she has this giant mole creature she rides around on."
"6522" "Zuko" "   Her shirshu.   It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the World.  It's the one shot we have of finding him."
"6523" "Toph" "   I don't know who this June lady is but  I like her."
"6524" "Aang" "   Hey Momo,  I just had the strangest dream.   Wait. . ."
"6525" "Aang" "   Where are we?  "
"6526" "Sokka" "  Hey, I remember her.  She helped you attack us!"
"6527" "Zuko" "  Yup, back in the good old days."
"6528" "Zuko" "  He's my Uncle, and he's not here."
"6529" "Katara" "  I'm not his girlfriend!"
"6530" "Zuko" "  She's not my girlfriend!"
"6531" "Zuko" "  I need your help finding the Avatar."
"6532" "Zuko" "   Does the end of the World  sound like more fun?"
"6533" "Katara" "  I have Aang's staff."
"6534" "Zuko" "   Well, what does that mean?"
"6535" "Toph" "  We know he's gone, that's why we're trying to find him."
"6536" "Aang" "  Where are we, Momo?   Maybe I'm in the Spirit World  But wait,  you can see me.  We can both  be in the Spirit World.   Nope,  my bending works.   Maybe if we climb  to the top of the island we could figure out where we are."
"6537" "Sokka" "  What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?   Do you mean he's. . .  you know, dead?"
"6538" "Toph" "  Helpful, real helpful."
"6539" "Zuko" "  Wait,  I have another idea.   There's only one other person in this World who can help us face the Fire Lord.   I'll be right back with a smell sample."
"6540" "Sokka" "  You saved your Uncle's sweaty sandal?"
"6541" "Toph" "  I think it's kind of sweet."
"6542" "Zuko" "  Hey, wait up!"
"6543" "Zuko" "  We're going to Ba Sing Se?"
"6544" "Zuko" "  It's been a long day.   Let's camp and start our search again at dawn."
"6545" "Aang" "  It's a hexagon.   It doesn't  seem raises his arms in exasperation and walks away like normal rock.   It's not made of earth.  This is so strange.   I wish I had some help right now.  I wish I had Roku.  I do have Roku."
"6546" "Aang" "   So where am I, Roku?  What is this place?"
"6547" "Aang" "  I am.   I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord."
"6548" "Aang" "  Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that."
"6549" "Toph" "  What's going on?   We're surrounded by old people."
"6550" "Katara" "  Not just any  old people.  These  are great masters and friends of ours.   Pakku."
"6551" "Katara" "  That's so exciting.   You and Gran Gran must be so happy to have found each other again."
"6552" "Sokka" "  Welcome to the family Great Gramp."
"6553" "Sokka" "   How about Grand Pakku?"
"6554" "Katara" "  And this was  Aang's first firebending teacher."
"6555" "Sokka" "  Master Piandao."
"6556" "Zuko" "   The Order of the White Lotus."
"6557" "Toph" "  Well that's who we're looking for."
"6558" "Sokka" "  He's gone.  And so is Aang."
"6559" "Aang" "  Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom."
"6560" "Aang" "   But you didn't really kill Chin,  technically he fell to his own doom because  he was too stubborn to get out of the way."
"6561" "Aang" "  I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi."
"6562" "Sokka" "  So Bumi,  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?"
"6563" "Zuko" "  Nah."
"6564" "Sokka" "  No, not really."
"6565" "Aang" "  I need to look deep inside myself."
"6566" "Zuko" "  Where. . .  where is he?"
"6567" "Katara" "  Are you okay?"
"6568" "Zuko" "  No,  I'm not okay.  My Uncle hates me, I know it.   He loved me and supported me in every way he could and I still turned against him.  How can I even face him?"
"6569" "Katara" "   Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?"
"6570" "Zuko" "  More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life."
"6571" "Katara" "   Then he'll forgive you.   He will."
"6572" "Zuko" "  Uncle."
"6573" "Aang" "   All these past Avatars,  they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it.  They don't get it.   You're right, maybe an air nomad Avatar would understand where I'm coming from.   I know you can't really talk.  Pretending you can just helps me think.   I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that."
"6574" "Aang" "   Avatar Yangchen, the monks always  taught me that all life is sacred.  Even the life of the tiniest spider- fly caught in its own web."
"6575" "Aang" "   I know, I'm  even a vegetarian.  I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever and I've only had to use violence for necessary defence and I've certainly  never used it to take a life."
"6576" "Aang" "  But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the World so my spirit could be free."
"6577" "Aang" "   I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.   I have to kill the Fire Lord."
"6578" "Zuko" "   How can you forgive me so easily?  I thought you would be furious with me."
"6579" "Iroh" "  I was never angry with you.  I was sad  because I was afraid you lost your way."
"6580" "Zuko" "   I did lose my way."
"6581" "Iroh" "  But you found it again.   And you did it by yourself.  And  I am so happy you found your way here."
"6582" "Zuko" "  It wasn't that hard, Uncle.   You have a pretty strong scent."
"6583" "Aang" "  Wait,  is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger?"
"6584" "Aang" "  They're not getting larger, they're getting closer.   The whole island is moving!"
"6585" "Aang" "   It's amazing, Momo!   The biggest animal in the World!   I've got to swim around and find its face."
"6586" "Zuko" "   Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar  who can possibly defeat the Father Lord."
"6587" "Toph" "   You mean the Fire Lord."
"6588" "Zuko" "  That's what I just said."
"6589" "Iroh" "  Hmm. . ."
"6590" "Zuko" "  We need you to come with us."
"6591" "Iroh" "   No, Zuko.  It won't turn out well."
"6592" "Zuko" "  You can beat him and we'll  be there to help."
"6593" "Iroh" "   Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that  I could.  It will be the wrong way to end the war.   History would see it as just more senseless violence,  a brother killing a brother to grab power.  The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord."
"6594" "Zuko" "   And then. . .  then would you come and take your rightful place on the throne?"
"6595" "Iroh" "   No.  Someone  new must take the throne.  An idealist with a pure heart and  unquestionable honour.  It has to be you,  Prince Zuko."
"6596" "Zuko" "   Unquestionable honour?  But I've made  so many mistakes."
"6597" "Iroh" "   Yes, you have.   You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you  restored your own honour.  And only you  can restore the honour of the Fire Nation."
"6598" "Zuko" "  I'll try, Uncle."
"6599" "Toph" "   Well,  what if Aang doesn't come back?"
"6600" "Iroh" "  Sozin's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us.  Aang will face the Fire Lord.   When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.   Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation so the Earth Kingdom can be free again."
"6601" "Iroh" "  Yes.   Zuko,  you must return to the Fire Nation so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.   But Azula will be there, waiting  for you."
"6602" "Zuko" "   I can handle Azula."
"6603" "Iroh" "   Not alone.   You'll need help."
"6604" "Zuko" "  You're right.   Katara,  how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?"
"6605" "Katara" "   It would be my pleasure."
"6606" "Sokka" "   What  about us?   What's  our destiny today?"
"6607" "Iroh" "   What do you think it is?"
"6608" "Sokka" "   I think that. . .  even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do  everything we can to stop the airship fleet."
"6609" "Toph" "  And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us."
"6610" "Sokka" "  Thank you, Master."
"6611" "Zuko" "  So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?"
"6612" "Iroh" "   After I re- conquer Ba Sing Se,  I'm going to re- conquer  my tea shop and I'm going  to play Pai Sho  everyday."
"6613" "Katara" "   Goodbye, General Iroh."
"6614" "Iroh" "  Goodbye, everyone.   Today,  destiny is our friend.   I know it."
"6615" "Aang" "  A lion turtle.   Maybe you can  help me.  Everyone,  even my own past lives are expecting me to end someone's life.  But I don't know if I can do it."
"6616" "Katara" "  Zuko, don't worry, we can take Azula."
"6617" "Zuko" "  I'm not worried about her, I'm worried about Aang.  What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my Father?  What if he loses?"
"6618" "Katara" "  Aang won't lose.  He's gonna come back.  He has to."
"6619" "Toph" "  Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the World."
"6620" "Sokka" "  We're too late!  The fleet's already taking off!"
"6621" "Toph" "  Then we're taking off too.  Where's the closest airship?"
"6622" "Sokka" "  It's right. . ."
"6623" "Toph" "  Ugh."
"6624" "Sokka" "  Shh."
"6625" "Toph" "  That's how it's done."
"6626" "Sokka" "  Good work, Toph.  Time to take control of the ship.  Take the wheel."
"6627" "Toph" "   That's a great idea!  Let the blind girl steer the giant airship."
"6628" "Sokka" "  I was talking to Suki."
"6629" "Toph" "  That would make a lot more sense."
"6630" "Sokka" "  Take us down closer to the water.  I've got an idea."
"6631" "Sokka" "   Attention crew, this is your Captain speaking.  Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and. . .  sweet cream.  We have a very special birthday to celebrate."
"6632" "Sokka" "  Fire Lord Ozai, here we come."
"6633" "Iroh" "  Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power."
"6634" "Sokka" "  We're not going to catch up to him in time."
"6635" "Aang" "  Momo, time for you to go."
"6636" "Sokka" "   It's Aang!  He's back!"
"6637" "Aang" "  Please listen to me.  We don't have to fight.  You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing."
"6638" "Sokka" "  Go, Aang!  Airbending slice!"
"6639" "Sokka" "  The Fire Lord is Aang's fight.  We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom."
"6640" "Toph" "  And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang?  I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal."
"6641" "Sokka" "   Airship slice!"
"6642" "Toph" "  Whoa.  That's a lot of fire, isn't it?"
"6643" "Sokka" "  It's going to be a rough ride.  We need to get to the top of this thing, fast."
"6644" "Sokka" "  Watch each other's backs and if we make it that far, I'll let you know."
"6645" "Sokka" "  Suki!"
"6646" "Sokka" "  No. . ."
"6647" "Toph" "  Sokka, I think we've gotta. . ."
"6648" "Zuko" "  Sorry, but you're not going to become Fire Lord today.   I am."
"6649" "Katara" "   And you're going down."
"6650" "Zuko" "  You're on."
"6651" "Katara" "  What are you doing?  She's playing you.  She knows she can't take us both so she is trying to separate us."
"6652" "Zuko" "  I know.  But I can take her this time."
"6653" "Katara" "  But even you admitted to your Uncle that you would need help facing Azula."
"6654" "Zuko" "  There's something off about her, I can't explain it but she's slipping.  And this way, no one else has to get hurt."
"6655" "Zuko" "   No, you're not."
"6656" "Zuko" "  No lightning, today?  What's the matter?  Afraid I'll re- direct it?"
"6657" "Zuko" "   No!"
"6658" "Katara" "  Zuko!"
"6659" "Sokka" "  Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in the turning position.  The ship will spiral and slam into the others."
"6660" "Toph" "  Got it."
"6661" "Sokka" "   Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?"
"6662" "Toph" "  You could stand to mention it more."
"6663" "Sokka" "   My leg!   Hang on Toph!"
"6664" "Toph" "  Aye aye, Captain."
"6665" "Sokka" "  Bye Space Sword."
"6666" "Sokka" " I don't think Boomerang is coming back, Toph.   It looks like this is the end."
"6667" "Toph" "  How did that happen?  Did Boomerang come back?"
"6668" "Sokka" "   No,  Suki did."
"6669" "Zuko" "  Thank you, Katara."
"6670" "Katara" "   I think I'm the one who should be thanking you."
"6671" "Aang" "   Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now  you shall pay the ultimate price."
"6672" "Aang" "   No. . .  I'm not going to end it like this."
"6673" "Aang" "  I took away your firebending.  You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again."
"6674" "Aang" "  I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance.  I took his bending away."
"6675" "Toph" "   Wow, who taught you that?"
"6676" "Aang" "   A giant Lion Turtle."
"6677" "Toph" "  You have the craziest adventures when you disappear."
"6678" "Sokka" "   Well, look at you buster.  Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the Loser Lord."
"6679" "Toph" "  Oh sorry, didn't mean to offend you Phoenix King of  Getting His Butt Whupped."
"6680" "Zuko" "   Mai!   You're ok.   They let you out of prison?"
"6681" "Zuko" "  So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?"
"6682" "Sokka" " Dad!"
"6683" "Katara" "  Dad!"
"6684" "Sokka" "   There's my favorite warriors.  I have to admit,  I kind of missed the face paint."
"6685" "Sokka" "   Careful Suki!  Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again."
"6686" "Zuko" "  I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down, and now. . ."
"6687" "Aang" "   And now we're friends."
"6688" "Zuko" "  Yeah. . . we are friends."
"6689" "Aang" "  I can't believe a year ago  I was still frozen in a block of ice.  The World's so different now."
"6690" "Zuko" "   And it's gonna be even more different, when we build it together."
"6691" "Zuko" "  Please, the real hero  is the Avatar."
"6692" "Zuko" "  Today, this war is finally over.   I promised  my Uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation, and I will.   The road ahead of us is challenging.  A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.   But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the  right path, and begin a new era of love and peace."
"6693" "Zuko" " You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.   Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life.   It put me on the right path; perhaps your time in here can do the same for you."
"6694" "Zuko" "   Because you are gong to tell me something.   Where is my mother?"
"6695" "Sokka" "  Zuko, stop moving!   I'm trying to capture the moment.   I wanted  to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together."
"6696" "Katara" "  That's very thoughtful of you Sokka.   Wait!   Why did you give me Momo's ears?"
"6697" "Sokka" "   Those are your hair loopies."
"6698" "Zuko" "  At least you don't look like a boarcupine.   My hair's not that spiky!"
"6699" "Sokka" "   I thought it looked more exciting that way."
"6700" "Sokka" "  Oh, you  think you can do a better job, Momo?"
"6701" "Iroh" "  Hey,  my belly's not that big anymore,  I've really trimmed down."
"6702" "Toph" "  Well, I think  you all look perfect! "
